the sample mean or empirical mean and the sample covariance are statistics computed from sample of data on one or more random variables
the sample mean is the average value or mean value of sample of numbers taken from larger population of numbers where population indicates not number of people but the entirety of relevant data whether collected or not
sample of companies sales from the fortune might be used for convenience instead of looking at the population all companies sales
the sample mean is used as an estimator for the population mean the average value in the entire population where the estimate is more likely to be close to the population mean if the sample is large and representative
the reliability of the sample mean is estimated using the standard error which in turn is calculated using the variance of the sample
if the sample is random the standard error falls with the size of the sample and the sample mean distribution approaches the normal distribution as the sample size increases
the term sample mean can also be used to refer to vector of average values when the statistician is looking at the values of several variables in the sample
the sales profits and employees of sample of fortune companies
in this case there is not just sample variance for each variable but sample variance covariance matrix or simply covariance matrix showing also the relationship between each pair of variables
this would be matrix when variables are being considered
the sample covariance is useful in judging the reliability of the sample means as estimators and is also useful as an estimate of the population covariance matrix
due to their ease of calculation and other desirable characteristics the sample mean and sample covariance are widely used in statistics to represent the location and dispersion of the distribution of values in the sample and to estimate the values for the population
definition of the sample mean the sample mean is the average of the values of variable in sample which is the sum of those values divided by the number of values
using mathematical notation if sample of observations on variable is taken from the population the sample mean is under this definition if the sample is taken from the population then the sample mean is as compared to the population mean of even if sample is random it is rarely perfectly representative and other samples would have other sample means even if the samples were all from the same population
the sample for example would have sample mean of if the statistician is interested in variables rather than one each observation having value for each of those variables the overall sample mean consists of sample means for individual variables
let be the ith independently drawn observation on the jth random variable
these observations can be arranged into column vectors each with entries with the column vector giving the th observations of all variables being denoted
the sample mean vector is column vector whose th element is the average value of the observations of the jth variable thus the sample mean vector contains the average of the observations for each variable and is written definition of sample covariance the sample covariance matrix is by matrix with entries where is an estimate of the covariance between the jth variable and the kth variable of the population underlying the data
in terms of the observation vectors the sample covariance is
alternatively arranging the observation vectors as the columns of matrix so that which is matrix of rows and columns
here the sample covariance matrix can be computed as where is an by vector of ones
if the observations are arranged as rows instead of columns so is now row vector and is an matrix whose column is the vector of observations on variable then applying transposes in the appropriate places yields
like covariance matrices for random vector sample covariance matrices are positive semi definite
to prove it note that for any matrix the matrix is positive semi definite
furthermore covariance matrix is positive definite if and only if the rank of the
vectors is unbiasedness the sample mean and the sample covariance matrix are unbiased estimates of the mean and the covariance matrix of the random vector row vector whose jth element is one of the random variables
the sample covariance matrix has in the denominator rather than due to variant of bessel correction in short the sample covariance relies on the difference between each observation and the sample mean but the sample mean is slightly correlated with each observation since it is defined in terms of all observations
if the population mean is known the analogous unbiased estimate using the population mean has in the denominator
this is an example of why in probability and statistics it is essential to distinguish between random variables upper case letters and realizations of the random variables lower case letters
the maximum likelihood estimate of the covariance for the gaussian distribution case has in the denominator as well
the ratio of to approaches for large so the maximum likelihood estimate approximately equals the unbiased estimate when the sample is large
distribution of the sample mean for each random variable the sample mean is good estimator of the population mean where good estimator is defined as being efficient and unbiased
of course the estimator will likely not be the true value of the population mean since different samples drawn from the same distribution will give different sample means and hence different estimates of the true mean
thus the sample mean is random variable not constant and consequently has its own distribution
for random sample of observations on the jth random variable the sample mean distribution itself has mean equal to the population mean and variance equal to where is the population variance
the arithmetic mean of population or population mean is often denoted the sample mean the arithmetic mean of sample of values drawn from the population makes good estimator of the population mean as its expected value is equal to the population mean that is it is an unbiased estimator
the sample mean is random variable not constant since its calculated value will randomly differ depending on which members of the population are sampled and consequently it will have its own distribution
for random sample of independent observations the expected value of the sample mean is and the variance of the sample mean is var if the samples are not independent but correlated then special care has to be taken in order to avoid the problem of pseudoreplication
if the population is normally distributed then the sample mean is normally distributed as follows
if the population is not normally distributed the sample mean is nonetheless approximately normally distributed if is large and
this is consequence of the central limit theorem
weighted samples in weighted sample each vector each set of single observations on each of the random variables is assigned weight without loss of generality assume that the weights are normalized
if they are not divide the weights by their sum
then the weighted mean vector is given by and the elements of the weighted covariance matrix are
if all weights are the same the weighted mean and covariance reduce to the biased sample mean and covariance mentioned above
criticism the sample mean and sample covariance are not robust statistics meaning that they are sensitive to outliers
as robustness is often desired trait particularly in real world applications robust alternatives may prove desirable notably quantile based statistics such as the sample median for location and interquartile range iqr for dispersion
other alternatives include trimming and winsorising as in the trimmed mean and the winsorized mean

in computer science and telecommunication hamming codes are family of linear error correcting codes
hamming codes can detect one bit and two bit errors or correct one bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors
by contrast the simple parity code cannot correct errors and can detect only an odd number of bits in error
hamming codes are perfect codes that is they achieve the highest possible rate for codes with their block length and minimum distance of three richard hamming invented hamming codes in as way of automatically correcting errors introduced by punched card readers
in his original paper hamming elaborated his general idea but specifically focused on the hamming code which adds three parity bits to four bits of data in mathematical terms hamming codes are class of binary linear code
for each integer there is code word with block length and message length hence the rate of hamming codes is which is the highest possible for codes with minimum distance of three the minimal number of bit changes needed to go from any code word to any other code word is three and block length the parity check matrix of hamming code is constructed by listing all columns of length that are non zero which means that the dual code of the hamming code is the shortened hadamard code
the parity check matrix has the property that any two columns are pairwise linearly independent
due to the limited redundancy that hamming codes add to the data they can only detect and correct errors when the error rate is low
this is the case in computer memory usually ram where bit errors are extremely rare and hamming codes are widely used and ram with this correction system is ecc ram ecc memory
in this context an extended hamming code having one extra parity bit is often used
extended hamming codes achieve hamming distance of four which allows the decoder to distinguish between when at most one one bit error occurs and when any two bit errors occur
in this sense extended hamming codes are single error correcting and double error detecting abbreviated as secded
history richard hamming the inventor of hamming codes worked at bell labs in the late on the bell model computer an electromechanical relay based machine with cycle times in seconds
input was fed in on punched paper tape seven eighths of an inch wide which had up to six holes per row
during weekdays when errors in the relays were detected the machine would stop and flash lights so that the operators could correct the problem
during after hours periods and on weekends when there were no operators the machine simply moved on to the next job
hamming worked on weekends and grew increasingly frustrated with having to restart his programs from scratch due to detected errors
in taped interview hamming said and so said damn it if the machine can detect an error why can it locate the position of the error and correct it
over the next few years he worked on the problem of error correction developing an increasingly powerful array of algorithms
in he published what is now known as hamming code which remains in use today in applications such as ecc memory
codes predating hamming number of simple error detecting codes were used before hamming codes but none were as effective as hamming codes in the same overhead of space
parity parity adds single bit that indicates whether the number of ones bit positions with values of one in the preceding data was even or odd
if an odd number of bits is changed in transmission the message will change parity and the error can be detected at this point however the bit that changed may have been the parity bit itself
the most common convention is that parity value of one indicates that there is an odd number of ones in the data and parity value of zero indicates that there is an even number of ones
if the number of bits changed is even the check bit will be valid and the error will not be detected
moreover parity does not indicate which bit contained the error even when it can detect it
the data must be discarded entirely and re transmitted from scratch
on noisy transmission medium successful transmission could take long time or may never occur
however while the quality of parity checking is poor since it uses only single bit this method results in the least overhead
two out of five code two out of five code is an encoding scheme which uses five bits consisting of exactly three and two
this provides ten possible combinations enough to represent the digits
this scheme can detect all single bit errors all odd numbered bit errors and some even numbered bit errors for example the flipping of both bits
however it still cannot correct any of these errors
repetition another code in use at the time repeated every data bit multiple times in order to ensure that it was sent correctly
for instance if the data bit to be sent is an repetition code will send if the three bits received are not identical an error occurred during transmission
if the channel is clean enough most of the time only one bit will change in each triple
therefore and each correspond to bit while and correspond to bit with the greater quantity of digits that are the same or indicating what the data bit should be
code with this ability to reconstruct the original message in the presence of errors is known as an error correcting code
this triple repetition code is hamming code with since there are two parity bits and data bit
such codes cannot correctly repair all errors however
in our example if the channel flips two bits and the receiver gets the system will detect the error but conclude that the original bit is which is incorrect
if we increase the size of the bit string to four we can detect all two bit errors but cannot correct them the quantity of parity bits is even at five bits we can both detect and correct all two bit errors but not all three bit errors
moreover increasing the size of the parity bit string is inefficient reducing throughput by three times in our original case and the efficiency drops drastically as we increase the number of times each bit is duplicated in order to detect and correct more errors
description if more error correcting bits are included with message and if those bits can be arranged such that different incorrect bits produce different error results then bad bits could be identified
in seven bit message there are seven possible single bit errors so three error control bits could potentially specify not only that an error occurred but also which bit caused the error
hamming studied the existing coding schemes including two of five and generalized their concepts
to start with he developed nomenclature to describe the system including the number of data bits and error correction bits in block
for instance parity includes single bit for any data word so assuming ascii words with seven bits hamming described this as an code with eight bits in total of which seven are data
the repetition example would be following the same logic
the code rate is the second number divided by the first for our repetition example
hamming also noticed the problems with flipping two or more bits and described this as the distance it is now called the hamming distance after him
parity has distance of so one bit flip can be detected but not corrected and any two bit flips will be invisible
the repetition has distance of as three bits need to be flipped in the same triple to obtain another code word with no visible errors
it can correct one bit errors or it can detect but not correct two bit errors
repetition each bit is repeated four times has distance of so flipping three bits can be detected but not corrected
when three bits flip in the same group there can be situations where attempting to correct will produce the wrong code word
in general code with distance can detect but not correct errors
hamming was interested in two problems at once increasing the distance as much as possible while at the same time increasing the code rate as much as possible
during the he developed several encoding schemes that were dramatic improvements on existing codes
the key to all of his systems was to have the parity bits overlap such that they managed to check each other as well as the data
general algorithm the following general algorithm generates single error correcting sec code for any number of bits
the main idea is to choose the error correcting bits such that the index xor the xor of all the bit positions containing is we use positions etc
in binary as the error correcting bits which guarantees it is possible to set the error correcting bits so that the index xor of the whole message is if the receiver receives string with index xor they can conclude there were no corruptions and otherwise the index xor indicates the index of the corrupted bit
an algorithm can be deduced from the following description number the bits starting from bit etc
write the bit numbers in binary etc
all bit positions that are powers of two have single bit in the binary form of their position are parity bits etc
all other bit positions with two or more bits in the binary form of their position are data bits
each data bit is included in unique set of or more parity bits as determined by the binary form of its bit position
parity bit covers all bit positions which have the least significant bit set bit the parity bit itself etc
parity bit covers all bit positions which have the second least significant bit set bits etc
parity bit covers all bit positions which have the third least significant bit set bits etc
parity bit covers all bit positions which have the fourth least significant bit set bits etc
in general each parity bit covers all bits where the bitwise and of the parity position and the bit position is non zero if byte of data to be encoded is then the data word using to represent the parity bits would be and the code word is the choice of the parity even or odd is irrelevant but the same choice must be used for both encoding and decoding
this general rule can be shown visually shown are only encoded bits parity data but the pattern continues indefinitely
the key thing about hamming codes that can be seen from visual inspection is that any given bit is included in unique set of parity bits
to check for errors check all of the parity bits
the pattern of errors called the error syndrome identifies the bit in error
if all parity bits are correct there is no error
otherwise the sum of the positions of the erroneous parity bits identifies the erroneous bit
for example if the parity bits in positions and indicate an error then bit is in error
if only one parity bit indicates an error the parity bit itself is in error
with parity bits bits from up to can be covered
after discounting the parity bits bits remain for use as data
as varies we get all the possible hamming codes hamming codes with additional parity secded hamming codes have minimum distance of which means that the decoder can detect and correct single error but it cannot distinguish double bit error of some codeword from single bit error of different codeword
thus some double bit errors will be incorrectly decoded as if they were single bit errors and therefore go undetected unless no correction is attempted
to remedy this shortcoming hamming codes can be extended by an extra parity bit
this way it is possible to increase the minimum distance of the hamming code to which allows the decoder to distinguish between single bit errors and two bit errors
thus the decoder can detect and correct single error and at the same time detect but not correct double error
if the decoder does not attempt to correct errors it can reliably detect triple bit errors
if the decoder does correct errors some triple errors will be mistaken for single errors and corrected to the wrong value
error correction is therefore trade off between certainty the ability to reliably detect triple bit errors and resiliency the ability to keep functioning in the face of single bit errors
this extended hamming code is popular in computer memory systems where it is known as secded abbreviated from single error correction double error detection
particularly popular is the code truncated hamming code plus an additional parity bit which has the same space overhead as parity code
hamming code in hamming introduced the hamming code
it encodes four data bits into seven bits by adding three parity bits
it can detect and correct single bit errors
with the addition of an overall parity bit it can also detect but not correct double bit errors
construction of and the matrix is called canonical generator matrix of linear code and is called parity check matrix
this is the construction of and in standard or systematic form
regardless of form and for linear block codes must satisfy an all zeros matrix since
the parity check matrix of hamming code is constructed by listing all columns of length that are pair wise independent
thus is matrix whose left side is all of the nonzero tuples where order of the tuples in the columns of matrix does not matter
the right hand side is just the identity matrix
so can be obtained from by taking the transpose of the left hand side of with the identity identity matrix on the left hand side of the code generator matrix and the parity check matrix are and finally these matrices can be mutated into equivalent non systematic codes by the following operations column permutations swapping columns elementary row operations replacing row with linear combination of rows encoding examplefrom the above matrix we have codewords
let be row vector of binary data bits
the codeword for any of the possible data vectors is given by the standard matrix product where the summing operation is done modulo
using the generator matrix from above we have after applying modulo to the sum hamming code with an additional parity bit the hamming code can easily be extended to an code by adding an extra parity bit on top of the encoded word see hamming
this can be summed up with the revised matrices and note that is not in standard form
to obtain elementary row operations can be used to obtain an equivalent matrix to in systematic form for example the first row in this matrix is the sum of the second and third rows of in non systematic form
using the systematic construction for hamming codes from above the matrix is apparent and the systematic form of is written as the non systematic form of can be row reduced using elementary row operations to match this matrix
the addition of the fourth row effectively computes the sum of all the codeword bits data and parity as the fourth parity bit
for example is encoded using the non systematic form of at the start of this section into where blue digits are data red digits are parity bits from the hamming code and the green digit is the parity bit added by the code
the green digit makes the parity of the codewords even
finally it can be shown that the minimum distance has increased from in the code to in the code
therefore the code can be defined as hamming code
to decode the hamming code first check the parity bit
if the parity bit indicates an error single error correction the hamming code will indicate the error location with no error indicating the parity bit
if the parity bit is correct then single error correction will indicate the bitwise exclusive or of two error locations
if the locations are equal no error then double bit error either has not occurred or has cancelled itself out
otherwise double bit error has occurred

working time is the period of time that person spends at paid labor
unpaid labor such as personal housework or caring for children or pets is not considered part of the working week
many countries regulate the work week by law such as stipulating minimum daily rest periods annual holidays and maximum number of working hours per week
working time may vary from person to person often depending on economic conditions location culture lifestyle choice and the profitability of the individual livelihood
for example someone who is supporting children and paying large mortgage might need to work more hours to meet basic costs of living than someone of the same earning power with lower housing costs
in developed countries like the united kingdom some workers are part time because they are unable to find full time work but many choose reduced work hours to care for children or other family some choose it simply to increase leisure time standard working hours or normal working hours refers to the legislation to limit the working hours per day per week per month or per year
the employer pays higher rates for overtime hours as required in the law
standard working hours of countries worldwide are around to hours per week but not everywhere from hours per week in france to up to hours per week in north korean labor camps and the additional overtime payments are around to above the normal hourly payments
maximum working hours refers to the maximum working hours of an employee
the employee cannot work more than the level specified in the maximum working hours law the world health organization and the international labour organization estimated that globally in one in ten workers were exposed to working or more hours per week and persons died as result of having heart disease event or stroke attributable to having worked these long hours making exposure to long working hours the occupational risk factor with the largest disease burden
hunter gatherer since the the consensus among anthropologists historians and sociologists has been that early hunter gatherer societies enjoyed more leisure time than is permitted by capitalist and agrarian societies for instance one camp of kung bushmen was estimated to work two and half days per week at around hours day
aggregated comparisons show that on average the working day was less than five hours subsequent studies in the examined the machiguenga of the upper amazon and the kayapo of northern brazil
these studies expanded the definition of work beyond purely hunting gathering activities but the overall average across the hunter gatherer societies he studied was still below hours while the maximum was below hours
popular perception is still aligned with the old academic consensus that hunter gatherers worked far in excess of modern humans forty hour week
history the industrial revolution made it possible for larger segment of the population to work year round because this labor was not tied to the season and artificial lighting made it possible to work longer each day
peasants and farm laborers moved from rural areas to work in urban factories and working time during the year increased significantly
before collective bargaining and worker protection laws there was financial incentive for company to maximize the return on expensive machinery by having long hours
records indicate that work schedules as long as twelve to sixteen hours per day six to seven days per week were practiced in some industrial sites
over the th century work hours shortened by almost half partly due to rising wages brought about by renewed economic growth and competition for skilled workers with supporting role from trade unions collective bargaining and progressive legislation
the workweek in most of the industrialized world dropped steadily to about hours after world war ii
the limitation of working hours is also proclaimed by the universal declaration of human rights international covenant on economic social and cultural rights and european social charter
the decline continued at faster pace in europe for example france adopted hour workweek in in china adopted hour week eliminating half day work on saturdays though this is not widely practiced
working hours in industrializing economies like south korea though still much higher than the leading industrial countries are also declining steadily
technology has also continued to improve worker productivity permitting standards of living to rise as hours decline
in developed economies as the time needed to manufacture goods has declined more working hours have become available to provide services resulting in shift of much of the workforce between sectors
economic growth in monetary terms tends to be concentrated in health care education government criminal justice corrections and other activities rather than those that contribute directly to the production of material goods in the mid the netherlands was the first country in the industrialized world where the overall average working week dropped to less than hours
gradual decrease most countries in the developed world have seen average hours worked decrease significantly
for example in the in the late th century it was estimated that the average work week was over hours per week
today the average hours worked in the is around with the average man employed full time for hours per work day and the average woman employed full time for hours per work day
the front runners for lowest average weekly work hours are the netherlands with hours and france with hours
in report of oecd countries germany had the lowest average working hours per week at hours the new economics foundation has recommended moving to hour standard work week to address problems with unemployment high carbon emissions low well being entrenched inequalities overworking family care and the general lack of free time
actual work week lengths have been falling in the developed world factors that have contributed to lowering average work hours and increasing standard of living have been technological advances in efficiency such as mechanization robotics and information technology
the increase of women equally participating in making income as opposed to previously being commonly bound to homemaking and childrearing exclusively
dropping fertility rates leading to fewer hours needed to be worked to support children recent articles supporting four day week have argued that reduced work hours would increase consumption and invigorate the economy
however other articles state that consumption would decrease which could reduce the environmental impact
other arguments for the four day week include improvements to workers level of education due to having extra time to take classes and courses and improvements to workers health less work related stress and extra time for exercise
reduced hours also save money on day care costs and transportation which in turn helps the environment with less carbon related emissions
these benefits increase workforce productivity on per hour basis
workweek structure the structure of the work week varies considerably for different professions and cultures
among salaried workers in the western world the work week often consists of monday to friday or saturday with the weekend set aside as time of personal work and leisure
sunday is set aside in the western world because it is the christian sabbath
the traditional american business hours are to monday to friday representing workweek of five eight hour days comprising hours in total
these are the origin of the phrase to used to describe conventional and possibly tedious job
negatively used it connotes tedious or unremarkable occupation
the phrase also indicates that person is an employee usually in large company rather than an entrepreneur or self employed
more neutrally it connotes job with stable hours and low career risk but still position of subordinate employment
the actual time at work often varies between and hours in practice due to the inclusion or lack of inclusion of breaks
in many traditional white collar positions employees were required to be in the office during these hours to take orders from the bosses hence the relationship between this phrase and subordination
workplace hours have become more flexible but the phrase is still commonly used even in situations where the term does not apply literally
average annual hours per worker oecd ranking trends over time by region europe in most european union countries working time is gradually decreasing
the european union working time directive imposes hour maximum working week that applies to every member state except malta which have an opt out meaning that employees in malta may work longer than hours if they wish but they cannot be forced to do so
major reason for the lower annual hours worked in europe is relatively high amount of paid annual leave
fixed employment comes with four to six weeks of holiday as standard
france france experimented in with sharp cut of legal or statutory working time of the employees in the private and public sector from hours week to hours week with the stated goal to fight against rampant unemployment at that time
the law on working time reduction is also referred to as the aubry law according to the name of the labor minister at that time
employees may and do work more than hours week yet in this case firms must pay them overtime bonuses
if the bonus is determined through collective negotiations it cannot be lower than
if no agreement on working time is signed the legal bonus must be of for the first hours then goes up to for the rest
including overtime the maximum working time cannot exceed hours per week and should not exceed hours per week over weeks in row
in france the labor law also regulates the minimum working hours part time jobs should not allow for less than hours per week without branch collective agreement
these agreements can allow for less under tight conditions
according to the official statistics dares after the introduction of the law on working time reduction actual hours per week performed by full time employed fell from hours in to trough of hours in then gradually went back to hours in in working hours were of
south korea south korea has the fastest shortening working time in the oecd which is the result of the government proactive move to lower working hours at all levels and to increase leisure and relaxation time which introduced the mandatory forty hour five day working week in for companies with over employees
beyond regular working hours it is legal to demand up to hours of overtime during the week plus another hours on weekends
the hour workweek expanded to companies with employees or more in employees or more in or more in or more in and full inclusion to all workers nationwide in july the government has continuously increased public holidays to days in more than the days of the united states and double that of the united kingdom days
despite those efforts south korea work hours are still relatively long with an average hours per year in
japan work hours in japan are decreasing but many japanese still work long hours
recently japan ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw issued draft report recommending major changes to the regulations that govern working hours
the centerpiece of the proposal is an exemption from overtime pay for white collar workers
japan has enacted an hour work day and hour work week hours in specified workplaces
the overtime limits are hours week hours over two weeks hours over four weeks hours month hours over two months and hours over three months however some workers get around these restrictions by working several hours day without clocking in whether physically or metaphorically
the overtime allowance should not be lower than and not more than of the normal hourly rate
workaholism in japan is considered serious social problem leading to early death phenomenon dubbed kar shi meaning death from overwork
mexico mexican laws mandate maximum of hours of work per week but they are rarely observed or enforced due to loopholes in the law the volatility of labor rights in mexico and its underdevelopment relative to other members countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd
indeed private sector employees often work overtime without receiving overtime compensation
fear of unemployment and threats by employers explain in part why the hour work week is disregarded
colombia articles to of the substantive work code in colombia provide for maximum of hours of work week
also the law notes that workdays should be divided into sections to allow break usually given as the meal time which is not counted as work
typically there is hours break for lunch that starts from through in june the colombian congress approved bill for the reduction of the work week from to hours which will be implemented in several stages from to
spain the main labor law in spain the workers statute act limits the amount of working time that an employee is obliged to perform
in the article of this law maximum of hours per day and hours per week are established employees typically receive either or payments per year with approximately days of vacation
according to spanish law spain holds what is known as the convenios colectivos which stipulates that different regulations and laws regarding employee work week and wage apply based on the type of job
overall they rank as the th highest in regard to international gdp growth according to study of the oecd better life index of spanish workers work more than hours per week compared to an average of of workers in oecd countries working hours are regulated by law
mandatory logging of employee working time has been in place since in an attempt by legislators to eliminate unpaid overtime and push for more transparency of actual working hours
non regulated pauses during the workday for coffee or smoking are not permitted to be documented as working time according to ruling by the spanish national court in february
traditional mid day break however one of the interesting aspects of the spanish work day and labor is the traditional presence of break around lunchtime
it is sometimes mistakenly thought to be due to siesta but in fact was due to workers returning to their families for the main midday meal
that break typically of or hours has been kept in the working culture because in the post civil war period most workers had two jobs to be able to sustain their families
following this tradition in small and medium sized cities restaurants and businesses shut down during this time period of for retail and for restaurants
many office jobs only allow one hour or even half hour breaks to eat the meal in office building restaurants or designated lunch rooms
majority of adults emphasize the lack of siesta during the typical work week
only one in ten spaniards take mid day nap percentage less than other european nations
australia in australia between and no marked change took place in the average amount of time spent at work by australians of prime working age that is between and years of age
throughout this period the average time spent at work by prime working age australians including those who did not spend any time at work remained stable at between and hours per week
this unchanging average however masks significant redistribution of work from men to women
between and the average time spent at work by prime working age australian men fell from to hours per week while the average time spent at work by prime working age australian women rose from to hours per week
in the period leading up to the amount of time australian workers spent at work outside the hours of to on weekdays also increased in rapid increase in the number of working hours was reported in study by the australia institute
the study found the average australian worked hours per year at work
according to clive hamilton of the australia institute this surpasses even japan
the australia institute believes that australians work the highest number of hours in the developed world the hour working week was introduced in the vast majority of full time employees in australia work additional overtime hours
survey found that of australia million full time workers million put in more than hours week including million who worked more than hours week and who put in more than hours
united states in the average man employed full time worked hours per work day and the average woman employed full time worked hours per work day
there is no mandatory minimum amount of paid time off for sickness or holiday but the majority of full time civilian workers have access to paid vacation time
by the united states government had inaugurated the hour work week for all federal employees
beginning in under the truman administration the united states became the first known industrialized nation to explicitly albeit secretly and permanently forswear reduction of working time
given the military industrial requirements of the cold war the authors of the then secret national security council report nsc proposed the us government undertake massive permanent national economic expansion that would let it siphon off part of the economic activity produced to support an ongoing military buildup to contain the soviet union
in his annual message to the congress president truman stated in terms of manpower our present defense targets will require an increase of nearly one million men and women in the armed forces within few months and probably not less than four million more in defense production by the end of the year
this means that an additional percent of our labor force and possibly much more will be required by direct defense needs by the end of the year
these manpower needs will call both for increasing our labor force by reducing unemployment and drawing in women and older workers and for lengthening hours of work in essential industries
according to the bureau of labor statistics the average non farm private sector employee worked hours per week as of june as president truman message had predicted the share of working women rose from percent of the labor force in to percent by growing at particularly rapid rate during the
according to bureau of labor statistics report issued may in the overall participation rate of women was percent
the rate rose to percent in percent in percent in and percent in and reached percent by the overall labor force participation rate of women is projected to attain its highest level in at percent
the inclusion of women in the work force can be seen as symbolic of social progress as well as of increasing american productivity and hours worked
between and official price inflation was measured to percent
president truman in his message to congress predicted correctly that his military buildup will cause intense and mounting inflationary pressures
using the data provided by the united states bureau of labor statistics erik rauch has estimated productivity to have increased by nearly
according to rauch if productivity means anything at all worker should be able to earn the same standard of living as worker in only hours per week
in the united states the working time for upper income professionals has increased compared to while total annual working time for low skill low income workers has decreased
this effect is sometimes called the leisure gap
the average working time of married couples of both spouses taken together rose from hours in to hours in
overtime rules many professional workers put in longer hours than the forty hour standard
in professional industries like investment banking and large law firms forty hour workweek is considered inadequate and may result in job loss or failure to be promoted
medical residents in the united states routinely work long hours as part of their training
workweek policies are not uniform in the many compensation arrangements are legal and three of the most common are wage commission and salary payment schemes
wage earners are compensated on per hour basis whereas salaried workers are compensated on per week or per job basis and commission workers get paid according to how much they produce or sell
under most circumstances wage earners and lower level employees may be legally required by an employer to work more than forty hours in week however they are paid extra for the additional work
many salaried workers and commission paid sales staff are not covered by overtime laws
these are generally called exempt positions because they are exempt from federal and state laws that mandate extra pay for extra time worked
the rules are complex but generally exempt workers are executives professionals or sales staff
for example school teachers are not paid extra for working extra hours
business owners and independent contractors are considered self employed and none of these laws apply to them
generally workers are paid time and half or times the worker base wage for each hour of work past forty
california also applies this rule to work in excess of eight hours per day but exemptions and exceptions significantly limit the applicability of this law
in some states firms are required to pay double time or twice the base rate for each hour of work past or each hour of work past in one day in california also subject to numerous exemptions and exceptions
this provides an incentive for companies to limit working time but makes these additional hours more desirable for the worker
it is not uncommon for overtime hours to be accepted voluntarily by wage earning workers
unions often treat overtime as desirable commodity when negotiating how these opportunities shall be partitioned among union members
brazil brazil has hour work week normally hours per day and hours on saturday or hours per day
jobs with no meal breaks or on duty meal breaks are hours per day
public servants work hours per week
lunch breaks are one hour and are not usually counted as work
typical work schedule is or in larger cities workers eat lunch on or near their work site while some workers in smaller cities may go home for lunch
day vacation is mandated by law
holidays vary by municipality with approximately to holidays per year
mainland china china adopted hour week eliminating half day work on saturdays
however this rule has never been truly enforced and unpaid or underpaid overtime working is common practice in china traditionally chinese have worked long hours and this has led to many deaths from overwork with the state media reporting in that people were dying suddenly annually some of them were dying from overwork
despite this work hours have reportedly been falling for about three decades due to rising productivity better labor laws and the spread of the two day weekend
the trend has affected both factories and white collar companies that have been responding to growing demands for easier work schedules
the working hour system as it is known is where employees work from to six days week excluding two hours of lunch nap during the noon and one hour of supper in the evening
alibaba founder jack yun ma and jd com founder richard qiangdong liu both praise the schedule saying such schedule has helped chinese tech giants like alibaba and tencent grow to become what they are today
hong kong hong kong has no legislation regarding maximum and normal working hours
the average weekly working hours of full time employees in hong kong is hours
according to the price and earnings report conducted by ubs while the global and regional average were and hours per year respectively the average working hours in hong kong is hours per year which ranked the fifth longest yearly working hours among countries under study
in addition from the survey conducted by the public opinion study group of the university of hong kong of the respondents agree that the problem of overtime work in hong kong is severe and of the respondents support the legislation on the maximum working hours
in hong kong of surveyed do not receive any overtime remuneration
these show that people in hong kong concerns the working time issues
as hong kong implemented the minimum wage law in may the chief executive donald tsang of the special administrative region pledged that the government will standardize working hours in hong kong on november the labour department of the hksar released the report of the policy study on standard working hours
the report covers three major areas including the regimes and experience of other places in regulating working hours latest working time situations of employees in different sectors and estimation of the possible impact of introducing standard working hour in hong kong
under the selected parameters from most loosen to most stringent the estimated increase in labour cost vary from billion to billion hkd and affect of total employees to of total employees various sectors of the community show concerns about the standard working hours in hong kong
the points are summarized as below labor organizations hong kong catholic commission for labour affairs urges the government to legislate the standard working hours in hong kong and suggests hours standard hours maximum working hours in week
the organization thinks that long working time adversely affects the family and social life and health of employees it also indicates that the current employment ordinance does not regulate overtime pays working time limits nor rest day pays which can protect employees rights
businesses and related organizations generally business sector agrees that it is important to achieve work life balance but does not support legislation to regulate working hours limit
they believe standard working hours is not the best way to achieve work life balance and the root cause of the long working hours in hong kong is due to insufficient labor supply
the managing director of century environmental services group catherine yan said employees may want to work more to obtain higher salary due to financial reasons
if standard working hour legislation is passed employers will need to pay higher salary to employees and hence the employers may choose to segment work tasks to employer more part time employees instead of providing overtime pay to employees
she thinks this will lead to situation that the employees may need to find two part time jobs to earn their living making them wasting more time on transportation from one job to another the chairman of the hong kong general chamber of commerce chow chung kong believes that it is so difficult to implement standard working hours that apply across the board specifically to accountants and barristers
in addition he believes that standard working hours may decrease individual employees working hours and would not increase their actual income
it may also lead to an increase of number of part timers in the labor market
according to study conducted jointly by the business economic and public affairs research centre and enterprise and social development research centre of hong kong shue yan university surveyed companies believe that standard working hours policy can be considered and surveyed think that it would be difficult to implement standard working hours in businesses employer representative in the labour advisory board stanley lau said that standard working hours will completely alter the business environment of hong kong affect small and medium enterprise and weaken competitiveness of businesses
he believes that the government can encourage employers to pay overtime salary and there is no need to regulate standard working hours
political parties on october the legislative council members in hong kong debated on the motion legislation for the regulation of working hours
cheung kwok che proposed the motion that is the council urges the government to introduce bill on the regulation of working hours within this legislative session the contents of which must include the number of standard weekly hours and overtime pay
as the motion was not passed by both functional constituencies and geographical constituencies it was negatived the hong kong federation of trade unions suggested standard hour work week with overtime pay of times the usual pay
it believes the regulation of standard working hour can prevent the employers to force employees to work overtime without pay elizabeth quat of the democratic alliance for the betterment and progress of hong kong dab believed that standard working hours were labor policy and was not related to family friendly policies
the vice president of young dab wai hung chan stated that standard working hours would bring limitations to small and medium enterprises
he thought that the government should discuss the topic with the public more before legislating standard working hours
the democratic party suggested hour standard work week and compulsory overtime pay to help achieve the balance between work rest and entertainment of people in hong kong the labour party believed regulating working hours could help achieve work life balance
it suggests an hour work day hour standard work week hour maximum work week and an overtime pay of times the usual pay poon siu ping of federation of hong kong and kowloon labour unions thought that it is possible to set work hour limit for all industries and the regulation on working hours can ensure the overtime payment by employers to employees and protect employees health
the civic party suggests to actively study setting weekly standard working hours at hours to align with family friendly policies in legco election member of economic synergy jeffery lam believes that standard working hours would adversely affect productivity tense the employer employee relationship and increase the pressure faced by businesses who suffer from inadequate workers
he does not support the regulation on working hours at its current situation
government matthew cheung kin chung the secretary for labour and welfare bureau said the executive council has already received the government report on working hours in june and the labour advisory board and the legco manpower panel will receive the report in late november and december respectively
on november the labour department released the report and the report covered the regimes and experience of practicing standard working hours in selected regions current work hour situations in different industries and the impact assessment of standard working hours
also matthew cheung mentioned that the government will form select committee by first quarter of which will include government officials representative of labor unions and employers associations academics and community leaders to investigate the related issues
he also said that it would perhaps be unrealistic to put forward bill for standard working hours in the next one to two years
academics yip siu fai professor of the department of social work and social administration of hku has noted that professions such as nursing and accountancy have long working hours and that this may affect people social life
he believes that standard working hours could help to give hong kong more family friendly workplaces and to increase fertility rates
randy chiu professor of the department of management of hkbu has said that introducing standard working hours could avoid excessively long working hours of employees
he also said that nowadays hong kong attains almost full employment has high rental price and severe inflation recently implemented minimum wage and is affected by gloomy global economy he also mentioned that comprehensive considerations on macroeconomic situations are needed and emphasized that it is perhaps inappropriate to adopt working time regulation as exemplified in other countries to hong kong lee shu kam associate professor of the department of economics and finance of hksyu believes that standard working hours cannot deliver work life balance
he referenced the research to the us by the university of california los angeles in and pointed out that in the industries and regions in which the wage elasticity is low the effects of standard working hours on lowering actual working time and increasing wages is limited for regions where the labor supply is inadequate standard working hours can protect employees benefits yet cause unemployment but for regions such as japan where the problem does not exist standard working hours would only lead to unemployment
in addition he said the effect of standard working hours is similar to that of for example giving overtime pay making employees to favor overtime work more
in this sense introducing standard working hours does not match its principle to shorten work time and to increase the recreation time of employees
he believed that the key point is to help employees to achieve work life balance and to get win win situation of employers and employees
francis lui head and professor of the department of economics of hong kong university of science and technology believed that standard working hours may not lower work time but increase unemployment
he used japan as an example to illustrate that the implementation of standard working hours lowered productivity per head and demotivated the economy
he also said that even if the standard working hours can shorten employees weekly working hours they may need to work for more years to earn sufficient amount of money for retirement
delay their retirement age
the total working time over the course of lifetime may not change lok sang ho professor of economics and director of the centre for public policy studies of lingnan university pointed out that as different employees perform various jobs and under different degrees of pressures it may not be appropriate to establish standard working hours in hong kong and he proposed hour maximum work week to protect workers health
taiwan in taiwan had the world th longest work hour and nd in asia with the average number of work hours hit hours
there had been reduction in the work hours by from to
malaysia since september the weekly work hour in malaysia was reduced from hours to hours after it was promulgated in the dewan negara
singapore singapore has an hour normal work day hours including lunchtime hour normal working week and maximum hour work week
if the employee works no more than five days week the employee normal working day is hours and the working week is hours
also if the number of hours worked by the worker is less than hours every alternate week the hour weekly limit may be exceeded in the other week
however this is subject to the pre specification in the service contract and the maximum should not exceed hours per week or hours in any consecutive two week period
in addition shift worker can work up to hours day provided that the average working hours per week do not exceed over consecutive three week period
the overtime allowance per overtime hour must not be less than times the employee hourly basic rates
other the kapauku people of papua think it is bad luck to work two consecutive days
the kung bushmen work two and half days per week rarely more than six hours per day

in linear algebra rotation matrix is transformation matrix that is used to perform rotation in euclidean space
for example using the convention below the matrix cos sin sin cos rotates points in the xy plane counterclockwise through an angle with respect to the positive axis about the origin of two dimensional cartesian coordinate system
to perform the rotation on plane point with standard coordinates it should be written as column vector and multiplied by the matrix cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos
if and are the endpoint coordinates of vector where is cosine and is sine then the above equations become the trigonometric summation angle formulae
indeed rotation matrix can be seen as the trigonometric summation angle formulae in matrix form
one way to understand this is say we have vector at an angle from the axis and we wish to rotate that angle by further
we simply need to compute the vector endpoint coordinates at
the examples in this article apply to active rotations of vectors counterclockwise in right handed coordinate system counterclockwise from by pre multiplication on the left
if any one of these is changed such as rotating axes instead of vectors passive transformation then the inverse of the example matrix should be used which coincides with its transpose
since matrix multiplication has no effect on the zero vector the coordinates of the origin rotation matrices describe rotations about the origin
rotation matrices provide an algebraic description of such rotations and are used extensively for computations in geometry physics and computer graphics
in some literature the term rotation is generalized to include improper rotations characterized by orthogonal matrices with determinant of instead of
these combine proper rotations with reflections which invert orientation
in other cases where reflections are not being considered the label proper may be dropped
the latter convention is followed in this article
rotation matrices are square matrices with real entries
more specifically they can be characterized as orthogonal matrices with determinant that is square matrix is rotation matrix if and only if rt and det the set of all orthogonal matrices of size with determinant is representation of group known as the special orthogonal group so one example of which is the rotation group so
the set of all orthogonal matrices of size with determinant or is representation of the general orthogonal group
in two dimensions in two dimensions the standard rotation matrix has the following form cos sin sin cos
this rotates column vectors by means of the following matrix multiplication cos sin sin cos
thus the new coordinates of point after rotation are cos sin sin cos
examples for example when the vector is rotated by an angle its new coordinates are cos sin and when the vector is rotated by an angle its new coordinates are sin cos
direction the direction of vector rotation is counterclockwise if is positive
and clockwise if is negative
thus the clockwise rotation matrix is found as cos sin sin cos
the two dimensional case is the only non trivial
not one dimensional case where the rotation matrices group is commutative so that it does not matter in which order multiple rotations are performed
an alternative convention uses rotating axes and the above matrices also represent rotation of the axes clockwise through an angle
non standard orientation of the coordinate system if standard right handed cartesian coordinate system is used with the axis to the right and the axis up the rotation is counterclockwise
if left handed cartesian coordinate system is used with directed to the right but directed down is clockwise
such non standard orientations are rarely used in mathematics but are common in computer graphics which often have the origin in the top left corner and the axis down the screen or page see below for other alternative conventions which may change the sense of the rotation produced by rotation matrix
common rotations particularly useful are the matrices for and counter clockwise rotations
relationship with complex plane since the matrices of the shape form ring isomorphic to the field of the complex numbers under this isomorphism the rotation matrices correspond to circle of the unit complex numbers the complex numbers of modulus if one identifies with through the linear isomorphism the action of matrix of the above form on vectors of corresponds to the multiplication by the complex number iy and rotations correspond to multiplication by complex numbers of modulus as every rotation matrix can be written cos sin sin cos the above correspondence associates such matrix with the complex number cos sin this last equality is euler formula
in three dimensions basic rotations basic rotation also called elemental rotation is rotation about one of the axes of coordinate system
the following three basic rotation matrices rotate vectors by an angle about the or axis in three dimensions using the right hand rule which codifies their alternating signs
the same matrices can also represent clockwise rotation of the axes
cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos for column vectors each of these basic vector rotations appears counterclockwise when the axis about which they occur points toward the observer the coordinate system is right handed and the angle is positive
rz for instance would rotate toward the axis vector aligned with the axis as can easily be checked by operating with rz on the vector cos sin sin cos this is similar to the rotation produced by the above mentioned two dimensional rotation matrix
see below for alternative conventions which may apparently or actually invert the sense of the rotation produced by these matrices
general rotations other rotation matrices can be obtained from these three using matrix multiplication
for example the product cos sin sin cos yaw cos sin sin cos pitch cos sin sin cos roll cos cos cos sin sin sin cos cos sin cos sin sin sin cos sin sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos sin cos cos represents rotation whose yaw pitch and roll angles are and respectively
more formally it is an intrinsic rotation whose tait bryan angles are about axes respectively
similarly the product cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos cos sin sin cos cos sin cos sin cos sin sin cos sin sin sin sin cos cos cos sin sin sin cos sin sin cos cos cos represents an extrinsic rotation whose improper euler angles are about axes these matrices produce the desired effect only if they are used to premultiply column vectors and since in general matrix multiplication is not commutative only if they are applied in the specified order see ambiguities for more details
the order of rotation operations is from right to left the matrix adjacent to the column vector is the first to be applied and then the one to the left
conversion from rotation matrix to axis angle every rotation in three dimensions is defined by its axis vector along this axis is unchanged by the rotation and its angle the amount of rotation about that axis euler rotation theorem
there are several methods to compute the axis and angle from rotation matrix see also axis angle representation
here we only describe the method based on the computation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the rotation matrix
it is also possible to use the trace of the rotation matrix
determining the axis given rotation matrix vector parallel to the rotation axis must satisfy since the rotation of around the rotation axis must result in the equation above may be solved for which is unique up to scalar factor unless further the equation may be rewritten which shows that lies in the null space of viewed in another way is an eigenvector of corresponding to the eigenvalue every rotation matrix must have this eigenvalue the other two eigenvalues being complex conjugates of each other
it follows that general rotation matrix in three dimensions has up to multiplicative constant only one real eigenvector
one way to determine the rotation axis is by showing that since rt is skew symmetric matrix we can choose such that
the matrix vector product becomes cross product of vector with itself ensuring that the result is zero therefore if then
the magnitude of computed this way is sin where is the angle of rotation
this does not work if is symmetric
above if rt is zero then all subsequent steps are invalid
in this case it is necessary to diagonalize and find the eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of
determining the angle to find the angle of rotation once the axis of the rotation is known select vector perpendicular to the axis
then the angle of the rotation is the angle between and rv
more direct method however is to simply calculate the trace the sum of the diagonal elements of the rotation matrix
care should be taken to select the right sign for the angle to match the chosen axis tr cos from which follows that the angle absolute value is arccos tr
rotation matrix from axis and angle the matrix of proper rotation by angle around the axis ux uy uz unit vector with is given by cos cos cos sin cos sin cos sin cos cos cos sin cos sin cos sin cos cos
derivation of this matrix from first principles can be found in section here
the basic idea to derive this matrix is dividing the problem into few known simple steps
first rotate the given axis and the point such that the axis lies in one of the coordinate planes xy yz or zx then rotate the given axis and the point such that the axis is aligned with one of the two coordinate axes for that particular coordinate plane or use one of the fundamental rotation matrices to rotate the point depending on the coordinate axis with which the rotation axis is aligned
reverse rotate the axis point pair such that it attains the final configuration as that was in step undoing step reverse rotate the axis point pair which was done in step undoing step this can be written more concisely as cos sin cos where is the cross product matrix of the expression is the outer product and is the identity matrix
alternatively the matrix entries are cos sin if sin sin if where jkl is the levi civita symbol with this is matrix form of rodrigues rotation formula or the equivalent differently parametrized euler rodrigues formula with
in the rotation of vector around the axis by an angle can be written as cos sin if the space is right handed and this rotation will be counterclockwise when points towards the observer right hand rule
explicitly with right handed orthonormal basis cos sin sin cos note the striking merely apparent differences to the equivalent lie algebraic formulation below
properties for any dimensional rotation matrix acting on the rotation is an orthogonal matrix it follows that det rotation is termed proper if det and improper or roto reflection if det
for even dimensions the eigenvalues of proper rotation occur as pairs of complex conjugates which are roots of unity for which is real only for
therefore there may be no vectors fixed by the rotation and thus no axis of rotation
any fixed eigenvectors occur in pairs and the axis of rotation is an even dimensional subspace
for odd dimensions proper rotation will have an odd number of eigenvalues with at least one and the axis of rotation will be an odd dimensional subspace
proof det det det det det det det det
here is the identity matrix and we use det rt det as well as since is odd
therefore det meaning there is null vector with that is rv fixed eigenvector
there may also be pairs of fixed eigenvectors in the even dimensional subspace orthogonal to so the total dimension of fixed eigenvectors is odd
for example in space rotation by angle has eigenvalues ei and so there is no axis of rotation except when the case of the null rotation
in space the axis of non null proper rotation is always unique line and rotation around this axis by angle has eigenvalues ei
in space the four eigenvalues are of the form
the null rotation has the case of is called simple rotation with two unit eigenvalues forming an axis plane and two dimensional rotation orthogonal to the axis plane
otherwise there is no axis plane
the case of is called an isoclinic rotation having eigenvalues repeated twice so every vector is rotated through an angle the trace of rotation matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues
for rotation by angle has trace cos for rotation around any axis by angle has trace cos for and the trace is cos cos which becomes cos for an isoclinic rotation
examples geometry in euclidean geometry rotation is an example of an isometry transformation that moves points without changing the distances between them
rotations are distinguished from other isometries by two additional properties they leave at least one point fixed and they leave handedness unchanged
in contrast translation moves every point reflection exchanges left and right handed ordering glide reflection does both and an improper rotation combines change in handedness with normal rotation
if fixed point is taken as the origin of cartesian coordinate system then every point can be given coordinates as displacement from the origin
thus one may work with the vector space of displacements instead of the points themselves
now suppose pn are the coordinates of the vector from the origin to point choose an orthonormal basis for our coordinates then the squared distance to by pythagoras is which can be computed using the matrix multiplication geometric rotation transforms lines to lines and preserves ratios of distances between points
from these properties it can be shown that rotation is linear transformation of the vectors and thus can be written in matrix form qp
the fact that rotation preserves not just ratios but distances themselves is stated as or because this equation holds for all vectors one concludes that every rotation matrix satisfies the orthogonality condition rotations preserve handedness because they cannot change the ordering of the axes which implies the special matrix condition det equally important it can be shown that any matrix satisfying these two conditions acts as rotation
multiplication the inverse of rotation matrix is its transpose which is also rotation matrix det det the product of two rotation matrices is rotation matrix det det det for multiplication of rotation matrices is generally not commutative
noting that any identity matrix is rotation matrix and that matrix multiplication is associative we may summarize all these properties by saying that the rotation matrices form group which for is non abelian called special orthogonal group and denoted by so so son or son the group of rotation matrices is isomorphic to the group of rotations in an dimensional space
this means that multiplication of rotation matrices corresponds to composition of rotations applied in left to right order of their corresponding matrices
ambiguities the interpretation of rotation matrix can be subject to many ambiguities
in most cases the effect of the ambiguity is equivalent to the effect of rotation matrix inversion for these orthogonal matrices equivalently matrix transpose
alias or alibi passive or active transformation the coordinates of point may change due to either rotation of the coordinate system cs alias or rotation of the point alibi
in the latter case the rotation of also produces rotation of the vector representing in other words either and are fixed while cs rotates alias or cs is fixed while and rotate alibi
any given rotation can be legitimately described both ways as vectors and coordinate systems actually rotate with respect to each other about the same axis but in opposite directions
throughout this article we chose the alibi approach to describe rotations
for instance cos sin sin cos represents counterclockwise rotation of vector by an angle or rotation of cs by the same angle but in the opposite direction
alibi and alias transformations are also known as active and passive transformations respectively
pre multiplication or post multiplication the same point can be represented either by column vector or row vector rotation matrices can either pre multiply column vectors rv or post multiply row vectors wr
however rv produces rotation in the opposite direction with respect to wr
throughout this article rotations produced on column vectors are described by means of pre multiplication
to obtain exactly the same rotation
the same final coordinates of point the equivalent row vector must be post multiplied by the transpose of
right or left handed coordinates the matrix and the vector can be represented with respect to right handed or left handed coordinate system
throughout the article we assumed right handed orientation unless otherwise specified
vectors or forms the vector space has dual space of linear forms and the matrix can act on either vectors or forms
decompositions independent planes consider the rotation matrix
if acts in certain direction purely as scaling by factor then we have so that thus is root of the characteristic polynomial for det
two features are noteworthy
first one of the roots or eigenvalues is which tells us that some direction is unaffected by the matrix
for rotations in three dimensions this is the axis of the rotation concept that has no meaning in any other dimension
second the other two roots are pair of complex conjugates whose product is the constant term of the quadratic and whose sum is cos the negated linear term
this factorization is of interest for rotation matrices because the same thing occurs for all of them
as special cases for null rotation the complex conjugates are both and for rotation they are both
furthermore similar factorization holds for any rotation matrix
if the dimension is odd there will be dangling eigenvalue of and for any dimension the rest of the polynomial factors into quadratic terms like the one here with the two special cases noted
we are guaranteed that the characteristic polynomial will have degree and thus eigenvalues
and since rotation matrix commutes with its transpose it is normal matrix so can be diagonalized
we conclude that every rotation matrix when expressed in suitable coordinate system partitions into independent rotations of two dimensional subspaces at most of them
the sum of the entries on the main diagonal of matrix is called the trace it does not change if we reorient the coordinate system and always equals the sum of the eigenvalues
this has the convenient implication for and rotation matrices that the trace reveals the angle of rotation in the two dimensional space or subspace
for matrix the trace is cos and for matrix it is cos in the three dimensional case the subspace consists of all vectors perpendicular to the rotation axis the invariant direction with eigenvalue
thus we can extract from any rotation matrix rotation axis and an angle and these completely determine the rotation
sequential angles the constraints on rotation matrix imply that it must have the form with therefore we may set cos and sin for some angle to solve for it is not enough to look at alone or alone we must consider both together to place the angle in the correct quadrant using two argument arctangent function
now consider the first column of rotation matrix
although will probably not equal but some value we can use slight variation of the previous computation to find so called givens rotation that transforms the column to zeroing this acts on the subspace spanned by the and axes
we can then repeat the process for the xz subspace to zero acting on the full matrix these two rotations produce the schematic form
shifting attention to the second column givens rotation of the yz subspace can now zero the value
this brings the full matrix to the form which is an identity matrix
thus we have decomposed as an rotation matrix will have or entries below the diagonal to zero
we can zero them by extending the same idea of stepping through the columns with series of rotations in fixed sequence of planes
we conclude that the set of rotation matrices each of which has entries can be parameterized by angles
in three dimensions this restates in matrix form an observation made by euler so mathematicians call the ordered sequence of three angles euler angles
however the situation is somewhat more complicated than we have so far indicated
despite the small dimension we actually have considerable freedom in the sequence of axis pairs we use and we also have some freedom in the choice of angles
thus we find many different conventions employed when three dimensional rotations are parameterized for physics or medicine or chemistry or other disciplines
when we include the option of world axes or body axes different sequences are possible
and while some disciplines call any sequence euler angles others give different names cardano tait bryan roll pitch yaw to different sequences
one reason for the large number of options is that as noted previously rotations in three dimensions and higher do not commute
if we reverse given sequence of rotations we get different outcome
this also implies that we cannot compose two rotations by adding their corresponding angles
thus euler angles are not vectors despite similarity in appearance as triplet of numbers
nested dimensions rotation matrix such as cos sin sin cos suggests rotation matrix cos sin sin cos is embedded in the upper left corner
this is no illusion not just one but many copies of dimensional rotations are found within dimensional rotations as subgroups
each embedding leaves one direction fixed which in the case of matrices is the rotation axis
for example we have cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos fixing the axis the axis and the axis respectively
the rotation axis need not be coordinate axis if is unit vector in the desired direction then sin cos where cos sin is rotation by angle leaving axis fixed
direction in dimensional space will be unit magnitude vector which we may consider point on generalized sphere sn
thus it is natural to describe the rotation group so as combining so and sn
suitable formalism is the fiber bundle where for every direction in the base space sn the fiber over it in the total space so is copy of the fiber space so namely the rotations that keep that direction fixed
thus we can build an rotation matrix by starting with matrix aiming its fixed axis on the ordinary sphere in three dimensional space aiming the resulting rotation on and so on up through sn
point on sn can be selected using numbers so we again have numbers to describe any rotation matrix
in fact we can view the sequential angle decomposition discussed previously as reversing this process
the composition of givens rotations brings the first column and row to so that the remainder of the matrix is rotation matrix of dimension one less embedded so as to leave fixed
skew parameters via cayley formula when an rotation matrix does not include eigenvalue thus none of the planar rotations which it comprises are rotations then is an invertible matrix
most rotation matrices fit this description and for them it can be shown that is skew symmetric matrix thus at and since the diagonal is necessarily zero and since the upper triangle determines the lower one contains independent numbers
conveniently is invertible whenever is skew symmetric thus we can recover the original matrix using the cayley transform which maps any skew symmetric matrix to rotation matrix
in fact aside from the noted exceptions we can produce any rotation matrix in this way
although in practical applications we can hardly afford to ignore rotations the cayley transform is still potentially useful tool giving parameterization of most rotation matrices without trigonometric functions
in three dimensions for example we have cayley
if we condense the skew entries into vector then we produce rotation around the axis for around the axis for and around the axis for
the rotations are just out of reach for in the limit as does approach rotation around the axis and similarly for other directions
decomposition into shears for the case rotation matrix can be decomposed into three shear matrices paeth tan sin tan this is useful for instance in computer graphics since shears can be implemented with fewer multiplication instructions than rotating bitmap directly
on modern computers this may not matter but it can be relevant for very old or low end microprocessors
rotation can also be written as two shears and scaling daubechies sweldens tan sin cos cos cos group theory below follow some basic facts about the role of the collection of all rotation matrices of fixed dimension here mostly in mathematics and particularly in physics where rotational symmetry is requirement of every truly fundamental law due to the assumption of isotropy of space and where the same symmetry when present is simplifying property of many problems of less fundamental nature
examples abound in classical mechanics and quantum mechanics
knowledge of the part of the solutions pertaining to this symmetry applies with qualifications to all such problems and it can be factored out of specific problem at hand thus reducing its complexity
prime example in mathematics and physics would be the theory of spherical harmonics
their role in the group theory of the rotation groups is that of being representation space for the entire set of finite dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation group so
for this topic see rotation group so spherical harmonics
the main articles listed in each subsection are referred to for more detail
lie group the rotation matrices for each form group the special orthogonal group so
this algebraic structure is coupled with topological structure inherited from gl in such way that the operations of multiplication and taking the inverse are analytic functions of the matrix entries
thus so is for each lie group
it is compact and connected but not simply connected
it is also semi simple group in fact simple group with the exception so
the relevance of this is that all theorems and all machinery from the theory of analytic manifolds analytic manifolds are in particular smooth manifolds apply and the well developed representation theory of compact semi simple groups is ready for use
lie algebra the lie algebra so of so is given by and is the space of skew symmetric matrices of dimension see classical group where is the lie algebra of the orthogonal group
for reference the most common basis for so is
exponential map connecting the lie algebra to the lie group is the exponential map which is defined using the standard matrix exponential series for ea for any skew symmetric matrix exp is always rotation matrix an important practical example is the case
in rotation group so it is shown that one can identify every so with an euler vector where is unit magnitude vector
by the properties of the identification is in the null space of thus is left invariant by exp and is hence rotation axis
according to rodrigues rotation formula on matrix form one obtains exp exp exp sin cos where
this is the matrix for rotation around axis by the angle for full detail see exponential map so
baker campbell hausdorff formula the bch formula provides an explicit expression for log exey in terms of series expansion of nested commutators of and this general expansion unfolds as
in the case the general infinite expansion has compact form for suitable trigonometric function coefficients detailed in the baker campbell hausdorff formula for so
as group identity the above holds for all faithful representations including the doublet spinor representation which is simpler
the same explicit formula thus follows straightforwardly through pauli matrices see the derivation for su
for the general case one might use ref
spin group the lie group of rotation matrices so is not simply connected so lie theory tells us it is homomorphic image of universal covering group
often the covering group which in this case is called the spin group denoted by spin is simpler and more natural to work with in the case of planar rotations so is topologically circle
its universal covering group spin is isomorphic to the real line under addition
whenever angles of arbitrary magnitude are used one is taking advantage of the convenience of the universal cover
every rotation matrix is produced by countable infinity of angles separated by integer multiples of
correspondingly the fundamental group of so is isomorphic to the integers in the case of spatial rotations so is topologically equivalent to three dimensional real projective space rp
its universal covering group spin is isomorphic to the sphere
every rotation matrix is produced by two opposite points on the sphere
correspondingly the fundamental group of so is isomorphic to the two element group
we can also describe spin as isomorphic to quaternions of unit norm under multiplication or to certain real matrices or to complex special unitary matrices namely su
the covering maps for the first and the last case are given by and
for detailed account of the su covering and the quaternionic covering see spin group so
many features of these cases are the same for higher dimensions
the coverings are all two to one with so having fundamental group
the natural setting for these groups is within clifford algebra
one type of action of the rotations is produced by kind of sandwich denoted by qvq
more importantly in applications to physics the corresponding spin representation of the lie algebra sits inside the clifford algebra
it can be exponentiated in the usual way to give rise to valued representation also known as projective representation of the rotation group
this is the case with so and su where the valued representation can be viewed as an inverse of the covering map
by properties of covering maps the inverse can be chosen ono to one as local section but not globally
infinitesimal rotations the matrices in the lie algebra are not themselves rotations the skew symmetric matrices are derivatives proportional differences of rotations
an actual differential rotation or infinitesimal rotation matrix has the form where is vanishingly small and so for instance with lx
the computation rules are as usual except that infinitesimals of second order are routinely dropped
with these rules these matrices do not satisfy all the same properties as ordinary finite rotation matrices under the usual treatment of infinitesimals
it turns out that the order in which infinitesimal rotations are applied is irrelevant
to see this exemplified consult infinitesimal rotations so
conversions we have seen the existence of several decompositions that apply in any dimension namely independent planes sequential angles and nested dimensions
in all these cases we can either decompose matrix or construct one
we have also given special attention to rotation matrices and these warrant further attention in both directions stuelpnagel
quaternion given the unit quaternion xi yj zk the equivalent pre multiplied to be used with column vectors rotation matrix is
now every quaternion component appears multiplied by two in term of degree two and if all such terms are zero what is left is an identity matrix
this leads to an efficient robust conversion from any quaternion whether unit or non unit to rotation matrix
given if otherwise we can calculate freed from the demand for unit quaternion we find that nonzero quaternions act as homogeneous coordinates for rotation matrices
the cayley transform discussed earlier is obtained by scaling the quaternion so that its component is for rotation around any axis will be zero which explains the cayley limitation
the sum of the entries along the main diagonal the trace plus one equals which is
thus we can write the trace itself as and from the previous version of the matrix we see that the diagonal entries themselves have the same form and so we can easily compare the magnitudes of all four quaternion components using the matrix diagonal
we can in fact obtain all four magnitudes using sums and square roots and choose consistent signs using the skew symmetric part of the off diagonal entries tr the trace of sgn sgn sgn alternatively use single square root and division tr this is numerically stable so long as the trace is not negative otherwise we risk dividing by nearly zero
in that case suppose qxx is the largest diagonal entry so will have the largest magnitude the other cases are derived by cyclic permutation then the following is safe
if the matrix contains significant error such as accumulated numerical error we may construct symmetric matrix and find the eigenvector of its largest magnitude eigenvalue
if is truly rotation matrix that value will be
the quaternion so obtained will correspond to the rotation matrix closest to the given matrix bar itzhack note formulation of the cited article is post multiplied works with row vectors
polar decomposition if the matrix is nonsingular its columns are linearly independent vectors thus the gram schmidt process can adjust them to be an orthonormal basis
stated in terms of numerical linear algebra we convert to an orthogonal matrix using qr decomposition
however we often prefer closest to which this method does not accomplish
for that the tool we want is the polar decomposition fan hoffman higham
to measure closeness we may use any matrix norm invariant under orthogonal transformations
convenient choice is the frobenius norm squared which is the sum of the squares of the element differences
writing this in terms of the trace tr our goal is find minimizing tr subject to qtq though written in matrix terms the objective function is just quadratic polynomial
we can minimize it in the usual way by finding where its derivative is zero
for matrix the orthogonality constraint implies six scalar equalities that the entries of must satisfy
to incorporate the constraint we may employ standard technique lagrange multipliers assembled as symmetric matrix thus our method is differentiate tr qtq with respect to the entries of and equate to zero
in general we obtain the equation so that where is orthogonal and is symmetric
to ensure minimum the matrix and hence must be positive definite
linear algebra calls qs the polar decomposition of with the positive square root of mtm
when is non singular the and factors of the polar decomposition are uniquely determined
however the determinant of is positive because is positive definite so inherits the sign of the determinant of that is is only guaranteed to be orthogonal not rotation matrix
this is unavoidable an with negative determinant has no uniquely defined closest rotation matrix
axis and angle to efficiently construct rotation matrix from an angle and unit axis we can take advantage of symmetry and skew symmetry within the entries
if and are the components of the unit vector representing the axis and cos sin then determining an axis and angle like determining quaternion is only possible up to the sign that is and correspond to the same rotation matrix just like and
additionally axis angle extraction presents additional difficulties
the angle can be restricted to be from to but angles are formally ambiguous by multiples of
when the angle is zero the axis is undefined
when the angle is the matrix becomes symmetric which has implications in extracting the axis
near multiples of care is needed to avoid numerical problems in extracting the angle two argument arctangent with atan sin cos equal to avoids the insensitivity of arccos and in computing the axis magnitude in order to force unit magnitude brute force approach can lose accuracy through underflow moler morrison
partial approach is as follows atan the and components of the axis would then be divided by fully robust approach will use different algorithm when the trace of the matrix is negative as with quaternion extraction
when is zero because the angle is zero an axis must be provided from some source other than the matrix
euler angles complexity of conversion escalates with euler angles used here in the broad sense
the first difficulty is to establish which of the twenty four variations of cartesian axis order we will use
suppose the three angles are physics and chemistry may interpret these as while aircraft dynamics may use
one systematic approach begins with choosing the rightmost axis
among all permutations of only two place that axis first one is an even permutation and the other odd
choosing parity thus establishes the middle axis
that leaves two choices for the left most axis either duplicating the first or not
these three choices gives us variations we double that to by choosing static or rotating axes
this is enough to construct matrix from angles but triples differing in many ways can give the same rotation matrix
for example suppose we use the zyz convention above then we have the following equivalent pairs angles for any order can be found using concise common routine herter lott shoemake
the problem of singular alignment the mathematical analog of physical gimbal lock occurs when the middle rotation aligns the axes of the first and last rotations
it afflicts every axis order at either even or odd multiples of
these singularities are not characteristic of the rotation matrix as such and only occur with the usage of euler angles
the singularities are avoided when considering and manipulating the rotation matrix as orthonormal row vectors in applications often named the right vector up vector and out vector instead of as angles
the singularities are also avoided when working with quaternions
vector to vector formulation in some instances it is interesting to describe rotation by specifying how vector is mapped into another through the shortest path smallest angle
in this completely describes the associated rotation matrix
in general given the matrix belongs to so and maps to
uniform random rotation matrices we sometimes need to generate uniformly distributed random rotation matrix
it seems intuitively clear in two dimensions that this means the rotation angle is uniformly distributed between and
that intuition is correct but does not carry over to higher dimensions
for example if we decompose rotation matrices in axis angle form the angle should not be uniformly distributed the probability that the magnitude of the angle is at most should be sin for since so is connected and locally compact lie group we have simple standard criterion for uniformity namely that the distribution be unchanged when composed with any arbitrary rotation lie group translation
this definition corresponds to what is called haar measure
le mass rivest show how to use the cayley transform to generate and test matrices according to this criterion
we can also generate uniform distribution in any dimension using the subgroup algorithm of diaconis shashahani
this recursively exploits the nested dimensions group structure of so as follows
generate uniform angle and construct rotation matrix
to step from to generate vector uniformly distributed on the sphere sn embed the matrix in the next larger size with last column and rotate the larger matrix so the last column becomes as usual we have special alternatives for the case
each of these methods begins with three independent random scalars uniformly distributed on the unit interval
arvo takes advantage of the odd dimension to change householder reflection to rotation by negation and uses that to aim the axis of uniform planar rotation
another method uses unit quaternions
multiplication of rotation matrices is homomorphic to multiplication of quaternions and multiplication by unit quaternion rotates the unit sphere
since the homomorphism is local isometry we immediately conclude that to produce uniform distribution on so we may use uniform distribution on
in practice create four element vector where each element is sampling of normal distribution
normalize its length and you have uniformly sampled random unit quaternion which represents uniformly sampled random rotation
note that the aforementioned only applies to rotations in dimension for generalised idea of quaternions one should look into rotors
euler angles can also be used though not with each angle uniformly distributed murnaghan miles
for the axis angle form the axis is uniformly distributed over the unit sphere of directions while the angle has the nonuniform distribution over noted previously miles

principal component analysis pca is popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing high number of dimensions features per observation increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data
formally pca is statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of dataset
this is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into new coordinate system where most of the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data
many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points
principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics microbiome studies and atmospheric science
the principal components of collection of points in real coordinate space are sequence of unit vectors where the th vector is the direction of line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first vectors
here best fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line
these directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated
principal component analysis pca is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform change of basis on the data sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest
in data analysis the first principal component of set of variables presumed to be jointly normally distributed is the derived variable formed as linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance
the second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed and we may proceed through iterations until all the variance is explained
pca is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set
pca is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models
it is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower dimensional data while preserving as much of the data variation as possible
the first principal component can equivalently be defined as direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data
the th principal component can be taken as direction orthogonal to the first principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data
for either objective it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix
thus the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix
pca is the simplest of the true eigenvector based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis
factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of slightly different matrix
pca is also related to canonical correlation analysis cca
cca defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross covariance between two datasets while pca defines new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in single dataset
robust and norm based variants of standard pca have also been proposed
history pca was invented in by karl pearson as an analogue of the principal axis theorem in mechanics it was later independently developed and named by harold hotelling in the
depending on the field of application it is also named the discrete karhunen lo ve transform klt in signal processing the hotelling transform in multivariate quality control proper orthogonal decomposition pod in mechanical engineering singular value decomposition svd of invented in the last quarter of the th century eigenvalue decomposition evd of xtx in linear algebra factor analysis for discussion of the differences between pca and factor analysis see ch
of jolliffe principal component analysis eckart young theorem harman or empirical orthogonal functions eof in meteorological science empirical eigenfunction decomposition sirovich empirical component analysis lorenz quasiharmonic modes brooks et al spectral decomposition in noise and vibration and empirical modal analysis in structural dynamics
intuition pca can be thought of as fitting dimensional ellipsoid to the data where each axis of the ellipsoid represents principal component
if some axis of the ellipsoid is small then the variance along that axis is also small
to find the axes of the ellipsoid we must first center the values of each variable in the dataset on by subtracting the mean of the variable observed values from each of those values
these transformed values are used instead of the original observed values for each of the variables
then we compute the covariance matrix of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix
then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to turn them into unit vectors
once this is done each of the mutually orthogonal unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data
this choice of basis will transform the covariance matrix into diagonalized form in which the diagonal elements represent the variance of each axis
the proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues
biplots and scree plots degree of explained variance are used to explain findings of the pca
details pca is defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate called the first principal component the second greatest variance on the second coordinate and so on consider an data matrix with column wise zero empirical mean the sample mean of each column has been shifted to zero where each of the rows represents different repetition of the experiment and each of the columns gives particular kind of feature say the results from particular sensor
mathematically the transformation is defined by set of size of dimensional vectors of weights or coefficients that map each row vector of to new vector of principal component scores given by in such way that the individual variables of considered over the data set successively inherit the maximum possible variance from with each coefficient vector constrained to be unit vector where is usually selected to be strictly less than to reduce dimensionality
first component in order to maximize variance the first weight vector thus has to satisfy arg max arg max equivalently writing this in matrix form gives arg max arg max since has been defined to be unit vector it equivalently also satisfies arg max the quantity to be maximised can be recognised as rayleigh quotient
standard result for positive semidefinite matrix such as xtx is that the quotient maximum possible value is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix which occurs when is the corresponding eigenvector
with found the first principal component of data vector can then be given as score in the transformed co ordinates or as the corresponding vector in the original variables
further components the th component can be found by subtracting the first principal components from and then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix arg max it turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of xtx with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues
thus the weight vectors are eigenvectors of xtx
the th principal component of data vector can therefore be given as score tk in the transformed coordinates or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables where is the kth eigenvector of xtx
the full principal components decomposition of can therefore be given as where is by matrix of weights whose columns are the eigenvectors of xtx
the transpose of is sometimes called the whitening or sphering transformation
columns of multiplied by the square root of corresponding eigenvalues that is eigenvectors scaled up by the variances are called loadings in pca or in factor analysis
covariances xtx itself can be recognized as proportional to the empirical sample covariance matrix of the dataset xt
the sample covariance between two of the different principal components over the dataset is given by where the eigenvalue property of has been used to move from line to line however eigenvectors and corresponding to eigenvalues of symmetric matrix are orthogonal if the eigenvalues are different or can be orthogonalised if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value
the product in the final line is therefore zero there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset
another way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix
in matrix form the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be written the empirical covariance matrix between the principal components becomes where is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of xtx
is equal to the sum of the squares over the dataset associated with each component that is tk
dimensionality reduction the transformation maps data vector from an original space of variables to new space of variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset
however not all the principal components need to be kept
keeping only the first principal components produced by using only the first eigenvectors gives the truncated transformation where the matrix tl now has rows but only columns
in other words pca learns linear transformation where the columns of matrix form an orthogonal basis for the features the components of representation that are decorrelated
by construction of all the transformed data matrices with only columns this score matrix maximises the variance in the original data that has been preserved while minimising the total squared reconstruction error or such dimensionality reduction can be very useful step for visualising and processing high dimensional datasets while still retaining as much of the variance in the dataset as possible
for example selecting and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two dimensional plane through the high dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out so if the data contains clusters these too may be most spread out and therefore most visible to be plotted out in two dimensional diagram whereas if two directions through the data or two of the original variables are chosen at random the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other making them indistinguishable
similarly in regression analysis the larger the number of explanatory variables allowed the greater is the chance of overfitting the model producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets
one approach especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables is to reduce them to few principal components and then run the regression against them method called principal component regression
dimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in dataset are noisy
if each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed gaussian noise then the columns of will also contain similarly identically distributed gaussian noise such distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix which can be thought of as high dimensional rotation of the co ordinate axes
however with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance the proportionate effect of the noise is less the first few components achieve higher signal to noise ratio
pca thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction while the later principal components may be dominated by noise and so disposed of without great loss
if the dataset is not too large the significance of the principal components can be tested using parametric bootstrap as an aid in determining how many principal components to retain
singular value decomposition the principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization the singular value decomposition svd of here is an by rectangular diagonal matrix of positive numbers called the singular values of is an by matrix the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length called the left singular vectors of and is by whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length and called the right singular vectors of in terms of this factorization the matrix xtx can be written where is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values of and the excess zeros chopped off that satisfies comparison with the eigenvector factorization of xtx establishes that the right singular vectors of are equivalent to the eigenvectors of xtx while the singular values of are equal to the square root of the eigenvalues of xtx
using the singular value decomposition the score matrix can be written so each column of is given by one of the left singular vectors of multiplied by the corresponding singular value
this form is also the polar decomposition of efficient algorithms exist to calculate the svd of without having to form the matrix xtx so computing the svd is now the standard way to calculate principal components analysis from data matrix unless only handful of components are required
as with the eigen decomposition truncated score matrix tl can be obtained by considering only the first largest singular values and their singular vectors the truncation of matrix or using truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of rank to the original matrix in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible frobenius norm result known as the eckart young theorem
further considerations the singular values in are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix xtx
each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the variance more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean that is associated with each eigenvector
the sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean
pca essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components
this moves as much of the variance as possible using an orthogonal transformation into the first few dimensions
the values in the remaining dimensions therefore tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information see below
pca is often used in this manner for dimensionality reduction
pca has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest variance as defined above
this advantage however comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared for example and when applicable to the discrete cosine transform and in particular to the dct ii which is simply known as the dct
nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than pca
pca is sensitive to the scaling of the variables
if we have just two variables and they have the same sample variance and are completely correlated then the pca will entail rotation by and the weights they are the cosines of rotation for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal
but if we multiply all values of the first variable by then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable with small contribution from the other variable whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable
this means that whenever the different variables have different units like temperature and mass pca is somewhat arbitrary method of analysis
different results would be obtained if one used fahrenheit rather than celsius for example
pearson original paper was entitled on lines and planes of closest fit to systems of points in space in space implies physical euclidean space where such concerns do not arise
one way of making the pca less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as basis for pca
however this compresses or expands the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance
mean centering is necessary for performing classical pca to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance
if mean subtraction is not performed the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data
mean of zero is needed for finding basis that minimizes the mean square error of the approximation of the data mean centering is unnecessary if performing principal components analysis on correlation matrix as the data are already centered after calculating correlations
correlations are derived from the cross product of two standard scores scores or statistical moments hence the name pearson product moment correlation
also see the article by kromrey foster johnson on mean centering in moderated regression much ado about nothing
since covariances are correlations of normalized variables or standard scores pca based on the correlation matrix of is equal to pca based on the covariance matrix of the standardized version of pca is popular primary technique in pattern recognition
it is not however optimized for class separability
however it has been used to quantify the distance between two or more classes by calculating center of mass for each class in principal component space and reporting euclidean distance between center of mass of two or more classes
the linear discriminant analysis is an alternative which is optimized for class separability
table of symbols and abbreviations properties and limitations of pca properties some properties of pca include property for any integer consider the orthogonal linear transformation where is element vector and is matrix and let be the variance covariance matrix for then the trace of denoted tr is maximized by taking where consists of the first columns of is the transpose of property consider again the orthonormal transformation with and defined as before
then tr is minimized by taking where consists of the last columns of the statistical implication of this property is that the last few pcs are not simply unstructured left overs after removing the important pcs
because these last pcs have variances as small as possible they are useful in their own right
they can help to detect unsuspected near constant linear relationships between the elements of and they may also be useful in regression in selecting subset of variables from and in outlier detection
property spectral decomposition of before we look at its usage we first look at diagonal elements var then perhaps the main statistical implication of the result is that not only can we decompose the combined variances of all the elements of into decreasing contributions due to each pc but we can also decompose the whole covariance matrix into contributions from each pc
although not strictly decreasing the elements of will tend to become smaller as increases as is nonincreasing for increasing whereas the elements of tend to stay about the same size because of the normalization constraints limitations as noted above the results of pca depend on the scaling of the variables
this can be cured by scaling each feature by its standard deviation so that one ends up with dimensionless features with unital variance the applicability of pca as described above is limited by certain tacit assumptions made in its derivation
in particular pca can capture linear correlations between the features but fails when this assumption is violated see figure in the reference
in some cases coordinate transformations can restore the linearity assumption and pca can then be applied see kernel pca
another limitation is the mean removal process before constructing the covariance matrix for pca
in fields such as astronomy all the signals are non negative and the mean removal process will force the mean of some astrophysical exposures to be zero which consequently creates unphysical negative fluxes and forward modeling has to be performed to recover the true magnitude of the signals
as an alternative method non negative matrix factorization focusing only on the non negative elements in the matrices which is well suited for astrophysical observations
see more at relation between pca and non negative matrix factorization
pca is at disadvantage if the data has not been standardized before applying the algorithm to it
pca transforms original data into data that is relevant to the principal components of that data which means that the new data variables cannot be interpreted in the same ways that the originals were
they are linear interpretations of the original variables
also if pca is not performed properly there is high likelihood of information loss pca relies on linear model
if dataset has pattern hidden inside it that is nonlinear then pca can actually steer the analysis in the complete opposite direction of progress
researchers at kansas state university discovered that the sampling error in their experiments impacted the bias of pca results
if the number of subjects or blocks is smaller than and or the researcher is interested in pc beyond the first it may be better to first correct for the serial correlation before pca is conducted
the researchers at kansas state also found that pca could be seriously biased if the autocorrelation structure of the data is not correctly handled
pca and information theory dimensionality reduction results in loss of information in general
pca based dimensionality reduction tends to minimize that information loss under certain signal and noise models
under the assumption that that is that the data vector is the sum of the desired information bearing signal and noise signal one can show that pca can be optimal for dimensionality reduction from an information theoretic point of view
in particular linsker showed that if is gaussian and is gaussian noise with covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix the pca maximizes the mutual information between the desired information and the dimensionality reduced output if the noise is still gaussian and has covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix that is the components of the vector are iid but the information bearing signal is non gaussian which is common scenario pca at least minimizes an upper bound on the information loss which is defined as
the optimality of pca is also preserved if the noise is iid and at least more gaussian in terms of the kullback leibler divergence than the information bearing signal in general even if the above signal model holds pca loses its information theoretic optimality as soon as the noise becomes dependent
computing pca using the covariance method the following is detailed description of pca using the covariance method see also here as opposed to the correlation method the goal is to transform given data set of dimension to an alternative data set of smaller dimension equivalently we are seeking to find the matrix where is the karhunen lo ve transform klt of matrix organize the data setsuppose you have data comprising set of observations of variables and you want to reduce the data so that each observation can be described with only variables suppose further that the data are arranged as set of data vectors with each representing single grouped observation of the variables
write as row vectors each with elements
place the row vectors into single matrix of dimensions calculate the empirical meanfind the empirical mean along each column place the calculated mean values into an empirical mean vector of dimensions calculate the deviations from the meanmean subtraction is an integral part of the solution towards finding principal component basis that minimizes the mean square error of approximating the data
hence we proceed by centering the data as follows subtract the empirical mean vector from each row of the data matrix store mean subtracted data in the matrix where is an column vector of all for in some applications each variable column of may also be scaled to have variance equal to see score
this step affects the calculated principal components but makes them independent of the units used to measure the different variables
find the covariance matrixfind the empirical covariance matrix from matrix where is the conjugate transpose operator
if consists entirely of real numbers which is the case in many applications the conjugate transpose is the same as the regular transpose
the reasoning behind using instead of to calculate the covariance is bessel correction find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrixcompute the matrix of eigenvectors which diagonalizes the covariance matrix where is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of this step will typically involve the use of computer based algorithm for computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues
these algorithms are readily available as sub components of most matrix algebra systems such as sas matlab mathematica scipy idl interactive data language or gnu octave as well as opencv
matrix will take the form of an diagonal matrix where is the jth eigenvalue of the covariance matrix and matrix also of dimension contains column vectors each of length which represent the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are ordered and paired
the jth eigenvalue corresponds to the jth eigenvector
matrix denotes the matrix of right eigenvectors as opposed to left eigenvectors
in general the matrix of right eigenvectors need not be the conjugate transpose of the matrix of left eigenvectors rearrange the eigenvectors and eigenvaluessort the columns of the eigenvector matrix and eigenvalue matrix in order of decreasing eigenvalue
make sure to maintain the correct pairings between the columns in each matrix compute the cumulative energy content for each eigenvectorthe eigenvalues represent the distribution of the source data energy among each of the eigenvectors where the eigenvectors form basis for the data
the cumulative energy content for the jth eigenvector is the sum of the energy content across all of the eigenvalues from through for select subset of the eigenvectors as basis vectorssave the first columns of as the matrix where use the vector as guide in choosing an appropriate value for the goal is to choose value of as small as possible while achieving reasonably high value of on percentage basis
for example you may want to choose so that the cumulative energy is above certain threshold like percent
in this case choose the smallest value of such that project the data onto the new basisthe projected data points are the rows of the matrix that is the first column of is the projection of the data points onto the first principal component the second column is the projection onto the second principal component etc
derivation of pca using the covariance method let be dimensional random vector expressed as column vector
without loss of generality assume has zero mean
we want to find orthonormal transformation matrix so that px has diagonal covariance matrix that is px is random vector with all its distinct components pairwise uncorrelated
quick computation assuming were unitary yields cov cov hence holds if and only if cov were diagonalisable by this is very constructive as cov is guaranteed to be non negative definite matrix and thus is guaranteed to be diagonalisable by some unitary matrix
covariance free computation in practical implementations especially with high dimensional data large the naive covariance method is rarely used because it is not efficient due to high computational and memory costs of explicitly determining the covariance matrix
the covariance free approach avoids the np operations of explicitly calculating and storing the covariance matrix xtx instead utilizing one of matrix free methods for example based on the function evaluating the product xt at the cost of np operations
iterative computation one way to compute the first principal component efficiently is shown in the following pseudo code for data matrix with zero mean without ever computing its covariance matrix
random vector of length norm do times vector of length for each row in rts is the eigenvalue error norm exit if error tolerance return this power iteration algorithm simply calculates the vector xt normalizes and places the result back in the eigenvalue is approximated by rt xtx which is the rayleigh quotient on the unit vector for the covariance matrix xtx
if the largest singular value is well separated from the next largest one the vector gets close to the first principal component of within the number of iterations which is small relative to at the total cost cnp
the power iteration convergence can be accelerated without noticeably sacrificing the small cost per iteration using more advanced matrix free methods such as the lanczos algorithm or the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient lobpcg method
subsequent principal components can be computed one by one via deflation or simultaneously as block
in the former approach imprecisions in already computed approximate principal components additively affect the accuracy of the subsequently computed principal components thus increasing the error with every new computation
the latter approach in the block power method replaces single vectors and with block vectors matrices and every column of approximates one of the leading principal components while all columns are iterated simultaneously
the main calculation is evaluation of the product xt
implemented for example in lobpcg efficient blocking eliminates the accumulation of the errors allows using high level blas matrix matrix product functions and typically leads to faster convergence compared to the single vector one by one technique
the nipals method non linear iterative partial least squares nipals is variant the classical power iteration with matrix deflation by subtraction implemented for computing the first few components in principal component or partial least squares analysis
for very high dimensional datasets such as those generated in the omics sciences for example genomics metabolomics it is usually only necessary to compute the first few pcs
the non linear iterative partial least squares nipals algorithm updates iterative approximations to the leading scores and loadings and by the power iteration multiplying on every iteration by on the left and on the right that is calculation of the covariance matrix is avoided just as in the matrix free implementation of the power iterations to xtx based on the function evaluating the product xt tx the matrix deflation by subtraction is performed by subtracting the outer product from leaving the deflated residual matrix used to calculate the subsequent leading pcs
for large data matrices or matrices that have high degree of column collinearity nipals suffers from loss of orthogonality of pcs due to machine precision round off errors accumulated in each iteration and matrix deflation by subtraction
gram schmidt re orthogonalization algorithm is applied to both the scores and the loadings at each iteration step to eliminate this loss of orthogonality
nipals reliance on single vector multiplications cannot take advantage of high level blas and results in slow convergence for clustered leading singular values both these deficiencies are resolved in more sophisticated matrix free block solvers such as the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient lobpcg method
online sequential estimation in an online or streaming situation with data arriving piece by piece rather than being stored in single batch it is useful to make an estimate of the pca projection that can be updated sequentially
this can be done efficiently but requires different algorithms
pca and qualitative variables in pca it is common that we want to introduce qualitative variables as supplementary elements
for example many quantitative variables have been measured on plants
for these plants some qualitative variables are available as for example the species to which the plant belongs
these data were subjected to pca for quantitative variables
when analyzing the results it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable species
for this the following results are produced
identification on the factorial planes of the different species for example using different colors
representation on the factorial planes of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species
for each center of gravity and each axis value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin these results are what is called introducing qualitative variable as supplementary element
this procedure is detailed in and husson pag and pag few software offer this option in an automatic way
this is the case of spad that historically following the work of ludovic lebart was the first to propose this option and the package factominer
applications intelligence the earliest application of factor analysis was in locating and measuring components of human intelligence
it was believed that intelligence had various uncorrelated components such as spatial intelligence verbal intelligence induction deduction etc and that scores on these could be adduced by factor analysis from results on various tests to give single index known as the intelligence quotient iq
the pioneering statistical psychologist spearman actually developed factor analysis in for his two factor theory of intelligence adding formal technique to the science of psychometrics
in thurstone looked for factors of intelligence developing the notion of mental age
standard iq tests today are based on this early work
residential differentiation in shevky and williams introduced the theory of factorial ecology which dominated studies of residential differentiation from the to the
neighbourhoods in city were recognizable or could be distinguished from one another by various characteristics which could be reduced to three by factor analysis
these were known as social rank an index of occupational status familism or family size and ethnicity cluster analysis could then be applied to divide the city into clusters or precincts according to values of the three key factor variables
an extensive literature developed around factorial ecology in urban geography but the approach went out of fashion after as being methodologically primitive and having little place in postmodern geographical paradigms
one of the problems with factor analysis has always been finding convincing names for the various artificial factors
in flood revived the factorial ecology approach to show that principal components analysis actually gave meaningful answers directly without resorting to factor rotation
the principal components were actually dual variables or shadow prices of forces pushing people together or apart in cities
the first component was accessibility the classic trade off between demand for travel and demand for space around which classical urban economics is based
the next two components were disadvantage which keeps people of similar status in separate neighbourhoods mediated by planning and ethnicity where people of similar ethnic backgrounds try to co locate about the same time the australian bureau of statistics defined distinct indexes of advantage and disadvantage taking the first principal component of sets of key variables that were thought to be important
these seifa indexes are regularly published for various jurisdictions and are used frequently in spatial analysis
development indexes pca has been the only formal method available for the development of indexes which are otherwise hit or miss ad hoc undertaking
the city development index was developed by pca from about indicators of city outcomes in survey of global cities
the first principal component was subject to iterative regression adding the original variables singly until about of its variation was accounted for
the index ultimately used about indicators but was good predictor of many more variables
its comparative value agreed very well with subjective assessment of the condition of each city
the coefficients on items of infrastructure were roughly proportional to the average costs of providing the underlying services suggesting the index was actually measure of effective physical and social investment in the city
the country level human development index hdi from undp which has been published since and is very extensively used in development studies has very similar coefficients on similar indicators strongly suggesting it was originally constructed using pca
population genetics in cavalli sforza and others pioneered the use of principal components analysis pca to summarise data on variation in human gene frequencies across regions
the components showed distinctive patterns including gradients and sinusoidal waves
they interpreted these patterns as resulting from specific ancient migration events
since then pca has been ubiquitous in population genetics with thousands of papers using pca as display mechanism
genetics varies largely according to proximity so the first two principal components actually show spatial distribution and may be used to map the relative geographical location of different population groups thereby showing individuals who have wandered from their original locations pca in genetics has been technically controversial in that the technique has been performed on discrete non normal variables and often on binary allele markers
the lack of any measures of standard error in pca are also an impediment to more consistent usage
in august the molecular biologist eran elhaik published theoretical paper in scientific reports analyzing pca applications
he concluded that it was easy to manipulate the method which in his view generated results that were erroneous contradictory and absurd
specifically he argued the results achieved in population genetics were characterized by cherry picking and circular reasoning
market research and indexes of attitude market research has been an extensive user of pca
it is used to develop customer satisfaction or customer loyalty scores for products and with clustering to develop market segments that may be targeted with advertising campaigns in much the same way as factorial ecology will locate geographical areas with similar characteristics pca rapidly transforms large amounts of data into smaller easier to digest variables that can be more rapidly and readily analyzed
in any consumer questionnaire there are series of questions designed to elicit consumer attitudes and principal components seek out latent variables underlying these attitudes
for example the oxford internet survey in asked people about their attitudes and beliefs and from these analysts extracted four principal component dimensions which they identified as escape social networking efficiency and problem creating another example from joe flood in extracted an attitudinal index toward housing from attitude questions in national survey of households in australia
the first principal component represented general attitude toward property and home ownership
the index or the attitude questions it embodied could be fed into general linear model of tenure choice
the strongest determinant of private renting by far was the attitude index rather than income marital status or household type
quantitative finance in quantitative finance principal component analysis can be directly applied to the risk management of interest rate derivative portfolios
trading multiple swap instruments which are usually function of other market quotable swap instruments is sought to be reduced to usually or principal components representing the path of interest rates on macro basis
converting risks to be represented as those to factor loadings or multipliers provides assessments and understanding beyond that available to simply collectively viewing risks to individual buckets
pca has also been applied to equity portfolios in similar fashion both to portfolio risk and to risk return
one application is to reduce portfolio risk where allocation strategies are applied to the principal portfolios instead of the underlying stocks
second is to enhance portfolio return using the principal components to select stocks with upside potential
neuroscience variant of principal components analysis is used in neuroscience to identify the specific properties of stimulus that increases neuron probability of generating an action potential
this technique is known as spike triggered covariance analysis
in typical application an experimenter presents white noise process as stimulus usually either as sensory input to test subject or as current injected directly into the neuron and records train of action potentials or spikes produced by the neuron as result
presumably certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike
in order to extract these features the experimenter calculates the covariance matrix of the spike triggered ensemble the set of all stimuli defined and discretized over finite time window typically on the order of ms that immediately preceded spike
the eigenvectors of the difference between the spike triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the prior stimulus ensemble the set of all stimuli defined over the same length time window then indicate the directions in the space of stimuli along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble
specifically the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the varince of the prior
since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to spike they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features
in neuroscience pca is also used to discern the identity of neuron from the shape of its action potential
spike sorting is an important procedure because extracellular recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron
in spike sorting one first uses pca to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms and then performs clustering analysis to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons
pca as dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles
it has been used in determining collective variables that is order parameters during phase transitions in the brain
relation with other methods correspondence analysis correspondence analysis ca was developed by jean paul benz cri and is conceptually similar to pca but scales the data which should be non negative so that rows and columns are treated equivalently
it is traditionally applied to contingency tables
ca decomposes the chi squared statistic associated to this table into orthogonal factors
because ca is descriptive technique it can be applied to tables for which the chi squared statistic is appropriate or not
several variants of ca are available including detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis
one special extension is multiple correspondence analysis which may be seen as the counterpart of principal component analysis for categorical data
factor analysis principal component analysis creates variables that are linear combinations of the original variables
the new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal
the pca transformation can be helpful as pre processing step before clustering
pca is variance focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable
pca is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction that is translating variable space into optimal factor space but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors
factor analysis is similar to principal component analysis in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables
different from pca factor analysis is correlation focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter correlations among variables in which the factors represent the common variance of variables excluding unique variance
in terms of the correlation matrix this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off diagonal terms that is shared co variance while pca focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal
however as side result when trying to reproduce the on diagonal terms pca also tends to fit relatively well the off diagonal correlations
results given by pca and factor analysis are very similar in most situations but this is not always the case and there are some problems where the results are significantly different
factor analysis is generally used when the research purpose is detecting data structure that is latent constructs or factors or causal modeling
if the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met then factor analysis will give erroneous results
means clustering it has been asserted that the relaxed solution of means clustering specified by the cluster indicators is given by the principal components and the pca subspace spanned by the principal directions is identical to the cluster centroid subspace
however that pca is useful relaxation of means clustering was not new result and it is straightforward to uncover counterexamples to the statement that the cluster centroid subspace is spanned by the principal directions
non negative matrix factorization non negative matrix factorization nmf is dimension reduction method where only non negative elements in the matrices are used which is therefore promising method in astronomy in the sense that astrophysical signals are non negative
the pca components are orthogonal to each other while the nmf components are all non negative and therefore constructs non orthogonal basis
in pca the contribution of each component is ranked based on the magnitude of its corresponding eigenvalue which is equivalent to the fractional residual variance frv in analyzing empirical data
for nmf its components are ranked based only on the empirical frv curves
the residual fractional eigenvalue plots that is as function of component number given total of components for pca has flat plateau where no data is captured to remove the quasi static noise then the curves dropped quickly as an indication of over fitting and captures random noise
the frv curves for nmf is decreasing continuously when the nmf components are constructed sequentially indicating the continuous capturing of quasi static noise then converge to higher levels than pca indicating the less over fitting property of nmf
iconography of correlations it is often difficult to interpret the principal components when the data include many variables of various origins or when some variables are qualitative
this leads the pca user to delicate elimination of several variables
if observations or variables have an excessive impact on the direction of the axes they should be removed and then projected as supplementary elements
in addition it is necessary to avoid interpreting the proximities between the points close to the center of the factorial plane
the iconography of correlations on the contrary which is not projection on system of axes does not have these drawbacks
we can therefore keep all the variables
the principle of the diagram is to underline the remarkable correlations of the correlation matrix by solid line positive correlation or dotted line negative correlation
strong correlation is not remarkable if it is not direct but caused by the effect of third variable
conversely weak correlations can be remarkable
for example if variable depends on several independent variables the correlations of with each of them are weak and yet remarkable
generalizations sparse pca particular disadvantage of pca is that the principal components are usually linear combinations of all input variables
sparse pca overcomes this disadvantage by finding linear combinations that contain just few input variables
it extends the classic method of principal component analysis pca for the reduction of dimensionality of data by adding sparsity constraint on the input variables
several approaches have been proposed including regression framework convex relaxation semidefinite programming framework generalized power method framework an alternating maximization framework forward backward greedy search and exact methods using branch and bound techniques bayesian formulation framework the methodological and theoretical developments of sparse pca as well as its applications in scientific studies were recently reviewed in survey paper
nonlinear pca most of the modern methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction find their theoretical and algorithmic roots in pca or means
pearson original idea was to take straight line or plane which will be the best fit to set of data points
trevor hastie expanded on this concept by proposing principal curves as the natural extension for the geometric interpretation of pca which explicitly constructs manifold for data approximation followed by projecting the points onto it as is illustrated by fig
see also the elastic map algorithm and principal geodesic analysis
another popular generalization is kernel pca which corresponds to pca performed in reproducing kernel hilbert space associated with positive definite kernel
in multilinear subspace learning pca is generalized to multilinear pca mpca that extracts features directly from tensor representations
mpca is solved by performing pca in each mode of the tensor iteratively
mpca has been applied to face recognition gait recognition etc
mpca is further extended to uncorrelated mpca non negative mpca and robust mpca
way principal component analysis may be performed with models such as tucker decomposition parafac multiple factor analysis co inertia analysis statis and distatis
robust pca while pca finds the mathematically optimal method as in minimizing the squared error it is still sensitive to outliers in the data that produce large errors something that the method tries to avoid in the first place
it is therefore common practice to remove outliers before computing pca
however in some contexts outliers can be difficult to identify
for example in data mining algorithms like correlation clustering the assignment of points to clusters and outliers is not known beforehand
recently proposed generalization of pca based on weighted pca increases robustness by assigning different weights to data objects based on their estimated relevancy
outlier resistant variants of pca have also been proposed based on norm formulations pca robust principal component analysis rpca via decomposition in low rank and sparse matrices is modification of pca that works well with respect to grossly corrupted observations
similar techniques independent component analysis independent component analysis ica is directed to similar problems as principal component analysis but finds additively separable components rather than successive approximations
network component analysis given matrix it tries to decompose it into two matrices such that key difference from techniques such as pca and ica is that some of the entries of are constrained to be here is termed the regulatory layer
while in general such decomposition can have multiple solutions they prove that if the following conditions are satisfied has full column rank each column of must have at least zeroes where is the number of columns of or alternatively the number of rows of
the justification for this criterion is that if node is removed from the regulatory layer along with all the output nodes connected to it the result must still be characterized by connectivity matrix with full column rank
must have full row rank then the decomposition is unique up to multiplication by scalar
discriminant analysis of principal components discriminant analysis of principal components dapc is multivariate method used to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals
genetic variation is partitioned into two components variation between groups and within groups and it maximizes the former
linear discriminants are linear combinations of alleles which best separate the clusters
alleles that most contribute to this discrimination are therefore those that are the most markedly different across groups
the contributions of alleles to the groupings identified by dapc can allow identifying regions of the genome driving the genetic divergence among groups in dapc data is first transformed using principal components analysis pca and subsequently clusters are identified using discriminant analysis da
dapc can be realized on using the package adegenet

in linear algebra the singular value decomposition svd is factorization of real or complex matrix
it generalizes the eigendecomposition of square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any matrix
it is related to the polar decomposition
specifically the singular value decomposition of an complex matrix is factorization of the form where is an complex unitary matrix is an rectangular diagonal matrix with non negative real numbers on the diagonal is an complex unitary matrix and is the conjugate transpose of such decomposition always exists for any complex matrix
if is real then and can be guaranteed to be real orthogonal matrices in such contexts the svd is often denoted the diagonal entries of are uniquely determined by and are known as the singular values of the number of non zero singular values is equal to the rank of the columns of and the columns of are called left singular vectors and right singular vectors of respectively
they form two sets of orthonormal bases um and vn and if they are sorted so that the singular values with value zero are all in the highest numbered columns or rows the singular value decomposition can be written as where min is the rank of the svd is not unique
it is always possible to choose the decomposition so that the singular values are in descending order
in this case but not and is uniquely determined by the term sometimes refers to the compact svd similar decomposition in which is square diagonal of size where min is the rank of and has only the non zero singular values
in this variant is an semi unitary matrix and is an semi unitary matrix such that mathematical applications of the svd include computing the pseudoinverse matrix approximation and determining the rank range and null space of matrix
the svd is also extremely useful in all areas of science engineering and statistics such as signal processing least squares fitting of data and process control
intuitive interpretations rotation coordinate scaling and reflection in the special case when is an real square matrix the matrices and can be chosen to be real matrices too
in that case unitary is the same as orthogonal
then interpreting both unitary matrices as well as the diagonal matrix summarized here as as linear transformation ax of the space rm the matrices and represent rotations or reflection of the space while represents the scaling of each coordinate xi by the factor
thus the svd decomposition breaks down any linear transformation of rm into composition of three geometrical transformations rotation or reflection followed by coordinate by coordinate scaling followed by another rotation or reflection
in particular if has positive determinant then and can be chosen to be both rotations with reflections or both rotations without reflections
if the determinant is negative exactly one of them will have reflection
if the determinant is zero each can be independently chosen to be of either type
if the matrix is real but not square namely with it can be interpreted as linear transformation from rn to rm
then and can be chosen to be rotations reflections of rm and rn respectively and besides scaling the first min coordinates also extends the vector with zeros
removes trailing coordinates so as to turn rn into rm
singular values as semiaxes of an ellipse or ellipsoid as shown in the figure the singular values can be interpreted as the magnitude of the semiaxes of an ellipse in
this concept can be generalized to dimensional euclidean space with the singular values of any square matrix being viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an dimensional ellipsoid
similarly the singular values of any matrix can be viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an dimensional ellipsoid in dimensional space for example as an ellipse in tilted plane in space
singular values encode magnitude of the semiaxis while singular vectors encode direction
see below for further details
the columns of and are orthonormal bases since and are unitary the columns of each of them form set of orthonormal vectors which can be regarded as basis vectors
the matrix maps the basis vector vi to the stretched unit vector ui
by the definition of unitary matrix the same is true for their conjugate transposes and except the geometric interpretation of the singular values as stretches is lost
in short the columns of and are orthonormal bases
when the is positive semidefinite hermitian matrix and are both equal to the unitary matrix used to diagonalize however when is not positive semidefinite and hermitian but still diagonalizable its eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition are distinct
geometric meaning because and are unitary we know that the columns um of yield an orthonormal basis of km and the columns vn of yield an orthonormal basis of kn with respect to the standard scalar products on these spaces
the linear transformation has particularly simple description with respect to these orthonormal bases we have min where is the th diagonal entry of and vi for min
the geometric content of the svd theorem can thus be summarized as follows for every linear map kn km one can find orthonormal bases of kn and km such that maps the th basis vector of kn to non negative multiple of the th basis vector of km and sends the left over basis vectors to zero
with respect to these bases the map is therefore represented by diagonal matrix with non negative real diagonal entries
to get more visual flavor of singular values and svd factorization at least when working on real vector spaces consider the sphere of radius one in rn
the linear map maps this sphere onto an ellipsoid in rm
non zero singular values are simply the lengths of the semi axes of this ellipsoid
especially when and all the singular values are distinct and non zero the svd of the linear map can be easily analyzed as succession of three consecutive moves consider the ellipsoid and specifically its axes then consider the directions in rn sent by onto these axes
these directions happen to be mutually orthogonal
apply first an isometry sending these directions to the coordinate axes of rn
on second move apply an endomorphism diagonalized along the coordinate axes and stretching or shrinking in each direction using the semi axes lengths of as stretching coefficients
the composition then sends the unit sphere onto an ellipsoid isometric to
to define the third and last move apply an isometry to this ellipsoid to obtain
as can be easily checked the composition coincides with example consider the matrix singular value decomposition of this matrix is given by the scaling matrix is zero outside of the diagonal grey italics and one diagonal element is zero red bold
furthermore because the matrices and are unitary multiplying by their respective conjugate transposes yields identity matrices as shown below
in this case because and are real valued each is an orthogonal matrix
this particular singular value decomposition is not unique
choosing such that is also valid singular value decomposition
svd and spectral decomposition singular values singular vectors and their relation to the svd non negative real number is singular value for if and only if there exist unit length vectors in km and in kn such that and the vectors and are called left singular and right singular vectors for respectively
in any singular value decomposition the diagonal entries of are equal to the singular values of the first min columns of and are respectively left and right singular vectors for the corresponding singular values
consequently the above theorem implies that an matrix has at most distinct singular values
it is always possible to find unitary basis for km with subset of basis vectors spanning the left singular vectors of each singular value of it is always possible to find unitary basis for kn with subset of basis vectors spanning the right singular vectors of each singular value of singular value for which we can find two left or right singular vectors that are linearly independent is called degenerate
if and are two left singular vectors which both correspond to the singular value then any normalized linear combination of the two vectors is also left singular vector corresponding to the singular value the similar statement is true for right singular vectors
the number of independent left and right singular vectors coincides and these singular vectors appear in the same columns of and corresponding to diagonal elements of all with the same value as an exception the left and right singular vectors of singular value comprise all unit vectors in the kernel and cokernel respectively of which by the rank nullity theorem cannot be the same dimension if even if all singular values are nonzero if then the cokernel is nontrivial in which case is padded with orthogonal vectors from the cokernel
conversely if then is padded by orthogonal vectors from the kernel
however if the singular value of exists the extra columns of or already appear as left or right singular vectors
non degenerate singular values always have unique left and right singular vectors up to multiplication by unit phase factor ei for the real case up to sign
consequently if all singular values of square matrix are non degenerate and non zero then its singular value decomposition is unique up to multiplication of column of by unit phase factor and simultaneous multiplication of the corresponding column of by the same unit phase factor
in general the svd is unique up to arbitrary unitary transformations applied uniformly to the column vectors of both and spanning the subspaces of each singular value and up to arbitrary unitary transformations on vectors of and spanning the kernel and cokernel respectively of relation to eigenvalue decomposition the singular value decomposition is very general in the sense that it can be applied to any matrix whereas eigenvalue decomposition can only be applied to diagonalizable matrices
nevertheless the two decompositions are related
given an svd of as described above the following two relations hold the right hand sides of these relations describe the eigenvalue decompositions of the left hand sides
consequently the columns of right singular vectors are eigenvectors of
the columns of left singular vectors are eigenvectors of mm
the non zero elements of non zero singular values are the square roots of the non zero eigenvalues of or mm in the special case that is normal matrix which by definition must be square the spectral theorem says that it can be unitarily diagonalized using basis of eigenvectors so that it can be written udu for unitary matrix and diagonal matrix with complex elements along the diagonal
when is positive semi definite will be non negative real numbers so that the decomposition udu is also singular value decomposition
otherwise it can be recast as an svd by moving the phase ei of each to either its corresponding vi or ui
the natural connection of the svd to non normal matrices is through the polar decomposition theorem sr where is positive semidefinite and normal and uv is unitary
thus except for positive semi definite matrices the eigenvalue decomposition and svd of while related differ the eigenvalue decomposition is udu where is not necessarily unitary and is not necessarily positive semi definite while the svd is where is diagonal and positive semi definite and and are unitary matrices that are not necessarily related except through the matrix while only non defective square matrices have an eigenvalue decomposition any matrix has svd
applications of the svd pseudoinverse the singular value decomposition can be used for computing the pseudoinverse of matrix
various authors use different notation for the pseudoinverse here we use
indeed the pseudoinverse of the matrix with singular value decomposition is where is the pseudoinverse of which is formed by replacing every non zero diagonal entry by its reciprocal and transposing the resulting matrix
the pseudoinverse is one way to solve linear least squares problems
solving homogeneous linear equations set of homogeneous linear equations can be written as ax for matrix and vector typical situation is that is known and non zero is to be determined which satisfies the equation
such an belongs to null space and is sometimes called right null vector of the vector can be characterized as right singular vector corresponding to singular value of that is zero
this observation means that if is square matrix and has no vanishing singular value the equation has no non zero as solution
it also means that if there are several vanishing singular values any linear combination of the corresponding right singular vectors is valid solution
analogously to the definition of right null vector non zero satisfying with denoting the conjugate transpose of is called left null vector of
total least squares minimization total least squares problem seeks the vector that minimizes the norm of vector ax under the constraint the solution turns out to be the right singular vector of corresponding to the smallest singular value
range null space and rank another application of the svd is that it provides an explicit representation of the range and null space of matrix the right singular vectors corresponding to vanishing singular values of span the null space of and the left singular vectors corresponding to the non zero singular values of span the range of for example in the above example the null space is spanned by the last two rows of and the range is spanned by the first three columns of as consequence the rank of equals the number of non zero singular values which is the same as the number of non zero diagonal elements in in numerical linear algebra the singular values can be used to determine the effective rank of matrix as rounding error may lead to small but non zero singular values in rank deficient matrix
singular values beyond significant gap are assumed to be numerically equivalent to zero
low rank matrix approximation some practical applications need to solve the problem of approximating matrix with another matrix said to be truncated which has specific rank in the case that the approximation is based on minimizing the frobenius norm of the difference between and under the constraint that rank it turns out that the solution is given by the svd of namely where is the same matrix as except that it contains only the largest singular values the other singular values are replaced by zero
this is known as the eckart young theorem as it was proved by those two authors in although it was later found to have been known to earlier authors see stewart
separable models the svd can be thought of as decomposing matrix into weighted ordered sum of separable matrices
by separable we mean that matrix can be written as an outer product of two vectors or in coordinates specifically the matrix can be decomposed as here ui and vi are the th columns of the corresponding svd matrices are the ordered singular values and each ai is separable
the svd can be used to find the decomposition of an image processing filter into separable horizontal and vertical filters
note that the number of non zero is exactly the rank of the matrix
separable models often arise in biological systems and the svd factorization is useful to analyze such systems
for example some visual area simple cells receptive fields can be well described by gabor filter in the space domain multiplied by modulation function in the time domain
thus given linear filter evaluated through for example reverse correlation one can rearrange the two spatial dimensions into one dimension thus yielding two dimensional filter space time which can be decomposed through svd
the first column of in the svd factorization is then gabor while the first column of represents the time modulation or vice versa
one may then define an index of separability which is the fraction of the power in the matrix which is accounted for by the first separable matrix in the decomposition
nearest orthogonal matrix it is possible to use the svd of square matrix to determine the orthogonal matrix closest to the closeness of fit is measured by the frobenius norm of the solution is the product uv
this intuitively makes sense because an orthogonal matrix would have the decomposition uiv where is the identity matrix so that if then the product uv amounts to replacing the singular values with ones
equivalently the solution is the unitary matrix uv of the polar decomposition rp in either order of stretch and rotation as described above
similar problem with interesting applications in shape analysis is the orthogonal procrustes problem which consists of finding an orthogonal matrix which most closely maps to specifically argmin subject to where denotes the frobenius norm
this problem is equivalent to finding the nearest orthogonal matrix to given matrix atb
the kabsch algorithm the kabsch algorithm called wahba problem in other fields uses svd to compute the optimal rotation with respect to least squares minimization that will align set of points with corresponding set of points
it is used among other applications to compare the structures of molecules
signal processing the svd and pseudoinverse have been successfully applied to signal processing image processing and big data in genomic signal processing
other examples the svd is also applied extensively to the study of linear inverse problems and is useful in the analysis of regularization methods such as that of tikhonov
it is widely used in statistics where it is related to principal component analysis and to correspondence analysis and in signal processing and pattern recognition
it is also used in output only modal analysis where the non scaled mode shapes can be determined from the singular vectors
yet another usage is latent semantic indexing in natural language text processing
in general numerical computation involving linear or linearized systems there is universal constant that characterizes the regularity or singularity of problem which is the system condition number max min
it often controls the error rate or convergence rate of given computational scheme on such systems the svd also plays crucial role in the field of quantum information in form often referred to as the schmidt decomposition
through it states of two quantum systems are naturally decomposed providing necessary and sufficient condition for them to be entangled if the rank of the matrix is larger than one
one application of svd to rather large matrices is in numerical weather prediction where lanczos methods are used to estimate the most linearly quickly growing few perturbations to the central numerical weather prediction over given initial forward time period the singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of the linearized propagator for the global weather over that time interval
the output singular vectors in this case are entire weather systems
these perturbations are then run through the full nonlinear model to generate an ensemble forecast giving handle on some of the uncertainty that should be allowed for around the current central prediction
svd has also been applied to reduced order modelling
the aim of reduced order modelling is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in complex system which is to be modeled
svd was coupled with radial basis functions to interpolate solutions to three dimensional unsteady flow problems interestingly svd has been used to improve gravitational waveform modeling by the ground based gravitational wave interferometer aligo
svd can help to increase the accuracy and speed of waveform generation to support gravitational waves searches and update two different waveform models
singular value decomposition is used in recommender systems to predict people item ratings
distributed algorithms have been developed for the purpose of calculating the svd on clusters of commodity machines low rank svd has been applied for hotspot detection from spatiotemporal data with application to disease outbreak detection
combination of svd and higher order svd also has been applied for real time event detection from complex data streams multivariate data with space and time dimensions in disease surveillance
existence proofs an eigenvalue of matrix is characterized by the algebraic relation mu
when is hermitian variational characterization is also available
let be real symmetric matrix
define by the extreme value theorem this continuous function attains maximum at some when restricted to the unit sphere
by the lagrange multipliers theorem necessarily satisfies for some real number the nabla symbol is the del operator differentiation with respect to
using the symmetry of we obtain therefore mu so is unit length eigenvector of for every unit length eigenvector of its eigenvalue is so is the largest eigenvalue of the same calculation performed on the orthogonal complement of gives the next largest eigenvalue and so on
the complex hermitian case is similar there is real valued function of real variables
singular values are similar in that they can be described algebraically or from variational principles
although unlike the eigenvalue case hermiticity or symmetry of is no longer required
this section gives these two arguments for existence of singular value decomposition
based on the spectral theorem let be an complex matrix
since is positive semi definite and hermitian by the spectral theorem there exists an unitary matrix such that where is diagonal and positive definite of dimension with the number of non zero eigenvalues of which can be shown to verify min
note that is here by definition matrix whose th column is the th eigenvector of corresponding to the eigenvalue moreover the th column of for is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue this can be expressed by writing as where the columns of and therefore contain the eigenvectors of corresponding to non zero and zero eigenvalues respectively
using this rewriting of the equation becomes
this implies that moreover the second equation implies finally the unitary ness of translates in terms of and into the following conditions where the subscripts on the identity matrices are used to remark that they are of different dimensions
let us now define then since this can be also seen as immediate consequence of the fact that this is equivalent to the observation that if is the set of eigenvectors of corresponding to non vanishing eigenvalues then is set of orthogonal vectors and is generally not complete set of orthonormal vectors
this matches with the matrix formalism used above denoting with the matrix whose columns are with the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of with vanishing eigenvalue and the matrix whose columns are the vectors we see that this is almost the desired result except that and are in general not unitary since they might not be square
however we do know that the number of rows of is no smaller than the number of columns since the dimensions of is no greater than and also since the columns in are orthonormal and can be extended to an orthonormal basis
this means that we can choose such that is unitary
for we already have to make it unitary
now define where extra zero rows are added or removed to make the number of zero rows equal the number of columns of and hence the overall dimensions of equal to then which is the desired result
notice the argument could begin with diagonalizing mm rather than this shows directly that mm and have the same non zero eigenvalues
based on variational characterization the singular values can also be characterized as the maxima of utmv considered as function of and over particular subspaces
the singular vectors are the values of and where these maxima are attained
let denote an matrix with real entries
let sk be the unit sphere in and define consider the function restricted to sm sn
since both sm and sn are compact sets their product is also compact
furthermore since is continuous it attains largest value for at least one pair of vectors sm and sn
this largest value is denoted and the corresponding vectors are denoted and
since is the largest value of it must be non negative
if it were negative changing the sign of either or would make it positive and therefore larger
are left and right singular vectors of with corresponding singular value
similar to the eigenvalues case by assumption the two vectors satisfy the lagrange multiplier equation after some algebra this becomes multiplying the first equation from left by and the second equation from left by and taking into account gives plugging this into the pair of equations above we have this proves the statement
more singular vectors and singular values can be found by maximizing over normalized which are orthogonal to and respectively
the passage from real to complex is similar to the eigenvalue case
calculating the svd the singular value decomposition can be computed using the following observations the left singular vectors of are set of orthonormal eigenvectors of mm
the right singular vectors of are set of orthonormal eigenvectors of
the non zero singular values of found on the diagonal entries of are the square roots of the non zero eigenvalues of both and mm
numerical approach the svd of matrix is typically computed by two step procedure
in the first step the matrix is reduced to bidiagonal matrix
this takes mn floating point operations flop assuming that the second step is to compute the svd of the bidiagonal matrix
this step can only be done with an iterative method as with eigenvalue algorithms
however in practice it suffices to compute the svd up to certain precision like the machine epsilon
if this precision is considered constant then the second step takes iterations each costing flops
thus the first step is more expensive and the overall cost is mn flops trefethen bau iii lecture
the first step can be done using householder reflections for cost of mn flops assuming that only the singular values are needed and not the singular vectors
if is much larger than then it is advantageous to first reduce the matrix to triangular matrix with the qr decomposition and then use householder reflections to further reduce the matrix to bidiagonal form the combined cost is mn flops trefethen bau iii lecture
the second step can be done by variant of the qr algorithm for the computation of eigenvalues which was first described by golub kahan
the lapack subroutine dbdsqr implements this iterative method with some modifications to cover the case where the singular values are very small demmel kahan
together with first step using householder reflections and if appropriate qr decomposition this forms the dgesvd routine for the computation of the singular value decomposition
the same algorithm is implemented in the gnu scientific library gsl
the gsl also offers an alternative method that uses one sided jacobi orthogonalization in step gsl team
this method computes the svd of the bidiagonal matrix by solving sequence of svd problems similar to how the jacobi eigenvalue algorithm solves sequence of eigenvalue methods golub van loan
yet another method for step uses the idea of divide and conquer eigenvalue algorithms trefethen bau iii lecture
there is an alternative way that does not explicitly use the eigenvalue decomposition
usually the singular value problem of matrix is converted into an equivalent symmetric eigenvalue problem such as or
the approaches that use eigenvalue decompositions are based on the qr algorithm which is well developed to be stable and fast
note that the singular values are real and right and left singular vectors are not required to form similarity transformations
one can iteratively alternate between the qr decomposition and the lq decomposition to find the real diagonal hermitian matrices
the qr decomposition gives and the lq decomposition of gives
thus at every iteration we have update and repeat the orthogonalizations
eventually this iteration between qr decomposition and lq decomposition produces left and right unitary singular matrices
this approach cannot readily be accelerated as the qr algorithm can with spectral shifts or deflation
this is because the shift method is not easily defined without using similarity transformations
however this iterative approach is very simple to implement so is good choice when speed does not matter
this method also provides insight into how purely orthogonal unitary transformations can obtain the svd
analytic result of svd the singular values of matrix can be found analytically
let the matrix be where are complex numbers that parameterize the matrix is the identity matrix and denote the pauli matrices
then its two singular values are given by re re re im im im reduced svds in applications it is quite unusual for the full svd including full unitary decomposition of the null space of the matrix to be required
instead it is often sufficient as well as faster and more economical for storage to compute reduced version of the svd
the following can be distinguished for an matrix of rank thin svd the thin or economy sized svd of matrix is given by where min the matrices uk and vk contain only the first columns of and and contains only the first singular values from the matrix uk is thus is diagonal and vk is
the thin svd uses significantly less space and computation time if max
the first stage in its calculation will usually be qr decomposition of which can make for significantly quicker calculation in this case
compact svd only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the non zero singular values are calculated
the remaining vectors of and are not calculated
this is quicker and more economical than the thin svd if min
the matrix ur is thus is diagonal and vr is
truncated svd in many applications the number of the non zero singular values is large making even the compact svd impractical to compute
in such cases the smallest singular values may need to be truncated to compute only non zero singular values
the truncated svd is no longer an exact decomposition of the original matrix but rather provides the optimal low rank matrix approximation by any matrix of fixed rank where matrix ut is is diagonal and vt is
only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the largest singular values are calculated
this can be much quicker and more economical than the compact svd if but requires completely different toolset of numerical solvers
in applications that require an approximation to the moore penrose inverse of the matrix the smallest singular values of are of interest which are more challenging to compute compared to the largest ones
truncated svd is employed in latent semantic indexing
norms ky fan norms the sum of the largest singular values of is matrix norm the ky fan norm of the first of the ky fan norms the ky fan norm is the same as the operator norm of as linear operator with respect to the euclidean norms of km and kn
in other words the ky fan norm is the operator norm induced by the standard euclidean inner product
for this reason it is also called the operator norm
one can easily verify the relationship between the ky fan norm and singular values
it is true in general for bounded operator on possibly infinite dimensional hilbert spaces but in the matrix case is normal matrix so is the largest eigenvalue of
the largest singular value of the last of the ky fan norms the sum of all singular values is the trace norm also known as the nuclear norm defined by tr the eigenvalues of are the squares of the singular values
hilbert schmidt norm the singular values are related to another norm on the space of operators
consider the hilbert schmidt inner product on the matrices defined by tr
so the induced norm is tr
since the trace is invariant under unitary equivalence this shows where are the singular values of this is called the frobenius norm schatten norm or hilbert schmidt norm of direct calculation shows that the frobenius norm of mij coincides with in addition the frobenius norm and the trace norm the nuclear norm are special cases of the schatten norm
variations and generalizations mode representation can be represented using mode multiplication of matrix applying then on the result that is tensor svd two types of tensor decompositions exist which generalise the svd to multi way arrays
one of them decomposes tensor into sum of rank tensors which is called tensor rank decomposition
the second type of decomposition computes the orthonormal subspaces associated with the different factors appearing in the tensor product of vector spaces in which the tensor lives
this decomposition is referred to in the literature as the higher order svd hosvd or tucker tuckerm
in addition multilinear principal component analysis in multilinear subspace learning involves the same mathematical operations as tucker decomposition being used in different context of dimensionality reduction
scale invariant svd the singular values of matrix are uniquely defined and are invariant with respect to left and or right unitary transformations of in other words the singular values of uav for unitary and are equal to the singular values of this is an important property for applications in which it is necessary to preserve euclidean distances and invariance with respect to rotations
the scale invariant svd or si svd is analogous to the conventional svd except that its uniquely determined singular values are invariant with respect to diagonal transformations of in other words the singular values of dae for invertible diagonal matrices and are equal to the singular values of this is an important property for applications for which invariance to the choice of units on variables metric versus imperial units is needed
higher order svd of functions hosvd tensor product tp model transformation numerically reconstruct the hosvd of functions
for further details please visit tensor product model transformation hosvd based canonical form of tp functions and qlpv models tp model transformation in control theory bounded operators on hilbert spaces the factorization can be extended to bounded operator on separable hilbert space namely for any bounded operator there exist partial isometry unitary measure space and non negative measurable such that where is the multiplication by on
this can be shown by mimicking the linear algebraic argument for the matricial case above
vtfv is the unique positive square root of as given by the borel functional calculus for self adjoint operators
the reason why need not be unitary is because unlike the finite dimensional case given an isometry with nontrivial kernel suitable may not be found such that is unitary operator
as for matrices the singular value factorization is equivalent to the polar decomposition for operators we can simply write and notice that is still partial isometry while vtfv is positive
singular values and compact operators the notion of singular values and left right singular vectors can be extended to compact operator on hilbert space as they have discrete spectrum
if is compact every non zero in its spectrum is an eigenvalue
furthermore compact self adjoint operator can be diagonalized by its eigenvectors
if is compact so is
applying the diagonalization result the unitary image of its positive square root tf has set of orthonormal eigenvectors
for any where the series converges in the norm topology on notice how this resembles the expression from the finite dimensional case
are called the singular values of can be considered the left singular resp
right singular vectors of compact operators on hilbert space are the closure of finite rank operators in the uniform operator topology
the above series expression gives an explicit such representation
an immediate consequence of this is theorem
is compact if and only if is compact
history the singular value decomposition was originally developed by differential geometers who wished to determine whether real bilinear form could be made equal to another by independent orthogonal transformations of the two spaces it acts on
eugenio beltrami and camille jordan discovered independently in and respectively that the singular values of the bilinear forms represented as matrix form complete set of invariants for bilinear forms under orthogonal substitutions
james joseph sylvester also arrived at the singular value decomposition for real square matrices in apparently independently of both beltrami and jordan
sylvester called the singular values the canonical multipliers of the matrix the fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is autonne in who arrived at it via the polar decomposition
the first proof of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by carl eckart and gale young in they saw it as generalization of the principal axis transformation for hermitian matrices
in erhard schmidt defined an analog of singular values for integral operators which are compact under some weak technical assumptions it seems he was unaware of the parallel work on singular values of finite matrices
this theory was further developed by mile picard in who is the first to call the numbers singular values or in french valeurs singuli res
practical methods for computing the svd date back to kogbetliantz in and hestenes in resembling closely the jacobi eigenvalue algorithm which uses plane rotations or givens rotations
however these were replaced by the method of gene golub and william kahan published in which uses householder transformations or reflections
in golub and christian reinsch published variant of the golub kahan algorithm that is still the one most used today

in linear algebra the trace of square matrix denoted tr is defined to be the sum of elements on the main diagonal from the upper left to the lower right of the trace is only defined for square matrix
it can be proved that the trace of matrix is the sum of its complex eigenvalues counted with multiplicities
it can also be proved that tr ab tr ba for any two matrices and this implies that similar matrices have the same trace
as consequence one can define the trace of linear operator mapping finite dimensional vector space into itself since all matrices describing such an operator with respect to basis are similar
the trace is related to the derivative of the determinant see jacobi formula
definition the trace of an square matrix is defined as where aii denotes the entry on the ith row and ith column of the entries of can be real numbers or more generally complex numbers
the trace is not defined for non square matrices
expressions like tr exp where is square matrix occur so often in some fields
multivariate statistical theory that shorthand notation has become common tre is sometimes referred to as the exponential trace function it is used in the golden thompson inequality
example let be matrix with then properties basic properties the trace is linear mapping
that is for all square matrices and and all scalars matrix and its transpose have the same trace this follows immediately from the fact that transposing square matrix does not affect elements along the main diagonal
trace of product the trace of square matrix which is the product of two real matrices can be rewritten as the sum of entry wise products of their elements
as the sum of all elements of their hadamard product
phrased directly if and are two real matrices then if one views any real matrix as vector of length mn an operation called vectorization then the above operation on and coincides with the standard dot product
according to the above expression tr is sum of squares and hence is nonnegative equal to zero if and only if is zero
furthermore as noted in the above formula tr tr
these demonstrate the positive definiteness and symmetry required of an inner product it is common to call tr the frobenius inner product of and this is natural inner product on the vector space of all real matrices of fixed dimensions
the norm derived from this inner product is called the frobenius norm and it satisfies submultiplicative property as can be proven with the cauchy schwarz inequality if and are real positive semi definite matrices of the same size
the frobenius inner product and norm arise frequently in matrix calculus and statistics
the frobenius inner product may be extended to hermitian inner product on the complex vector space of all complex matrices of fixed size by replacing by its complex conjugate
the symmetry of the frobenius inner product may be phrased more directly as follows the matrices in the trace of product can be switched without changing the result
if and are and real or complex matrices respectively then this is notable both for the fact that ab does not usually equal ba and also since the trace of either does not usually equal tr tr
the similarity invariance of the trace meaning that tr tr ap for any square matrix and any invertible matrix of the same dimensions is fundamental consequence
this is proved by similarity invariance is the crucial property of the trace in order to discuss traces of linear transformations as below
additionally for real column vectors and the trace of the outer product is equivalent to the inner product cyclic property more generally the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations that is this is known as the cyclic property
arbitrary permutations are not allowed in general however if products of three symmetric matrices are considered any permutation is allowed since where the first equality is because the traces of matrix and its transpose are equal
note that this is not true in general for more than three factors
trace of kronecker product the trace of the kronecker product of two matrices is the product of their traces characterization of the trace the following three properties characterize the trace up to scalar multiple in the following sense if is linear functional on the space of square matrices that satisfies then and tr are proportional for matrices imposing the normalization makes equal to the trace
trace as the sum of eigenvalues given any real or complex matrix there is where are the eigenvalues of counted with multiplicity
this holds true even if is real matrix and some or all of the eigenvalues are complex numbers
this may be regarded as consequence of the existence of the jordan canonical form together with the similarity invariance of the trace discussed above
trace of commutator when both and are matrices the trace of the ring theoretic commutator of and vanishes tr because tr ab tr ba and tr is linear
one can state this as the trace is map of lie algebras gln from operators to scalars as the commutator of scalars is trivial it is an abelian lie algebra
in particular using similarity invariance it follows that the identity matrix is never similar to the commutator of any pair of matrices
conversely any square matrix with zero trace is linear combinations of the commutators of pairs of matrices
moreover any square matrix with zero trace is unitarily equivalent to square matrix with diagonal consisting of all zeros
traces of special kinds of matrices the trace of the identity matrix is the dimension of the space namely this leads to generalizations of dimension using trace the trace of hermitian matrix is real because the elements on the diagonal are real
the trace of permutation matrix is the number of fixed points of the corresponding permutation because the diagonal term aii is if the ith point is fixed and otherwise
the trace of projection matrix is the dimension of the target space
the matrix px is idempotent more generally the trace of any idempotent matrix
one with equals its own rank
the trace of nilpotent matrix is zero when the characteristic of the base field is zero the converse also holds if tr ak for all then is nilpotent
when the characteristic is positive the identity in dimensions is counterexample as tr tr but the identity is not nilpotent
relationship to eigenvalues if is linear operator represented by square matrix with real or complex entries and if are the eigenvalues of listed according to their algebraic multiplicities then this follows from the fact that is always similar to its jordan form an upper triangular matrix having on the main diagonal
in contrast the determinant of is the product of its eigenvalues that is derivative relationships if is square matrix with small entries and denotes the identity matrix then we have approximately precisely this means that the trace is the derivative of the determinant function at the identity matrix
jacobi formula is more general and describes the differential of the determinant at an arbitrary square matrix in terms of the trace and the adjugate of the matrix
from this or from the connection between the trace and the eigenvalues one can derive relation between the trace function the matrix exponential function and the determinant related characterization of the trace applies to linear vector fields
given matrix define vector field on rn by ax
the components of this vector field are linear functions given by the rows of
its divergence div is constant function whose value is equal to tr
by the divergence theorem one can interpret this in terms of flows if represents the velocity of fluid at location and is region in rn the net flow of the fluid out of is given by tr vol where vol is the volume of the trace is linear operator hence it commutes with the derivative trace of linear operator in general given some linear map where is finite dimensional vector space we can define the trace of this map by considering the trace of matrix representation of that is choosing basis for and describing as matrix relative to this basis and taking the trace of this square matrix
the result will not depend on the basis chosen since different bases will give rise to similar matrices allowing for the possibility of basis independent definition for the trace of linear map
such definition can be given using the canonical isomorphism between the space end of linear maps on and where is the dual space of let be in and let be in
then the trace of the indecomposable element is defined to be the trace of general element is defined by linearity
using an explicit basis for and the corresponding dual basis for one can show that this gives the same definition of the trace as given above
numerical algorithms stochastic estimator the trace can be estimated unbiasedly by hutchinson trick given any matrix and any random with we have
proof expand the expectation directly
usually the random vector is sampled from normal distribution or rademacher distribution
more sophisticated stochastic estimators of trace have been developed
applications if real matrix has zero trace its square is diagonal matrix
the trace of complex matrix is used to classify bius transformations
first the matrix is normalized to make its determinant equal to one
then if the square of the trace is the corresponding transformation is parabolic
if the square is in the interval it is elliptic
finally if the square is greater than the transformation is loxodromic
see classification of bius transformations
the trace is used to define characters of group representations
two representations gl of group are equivalent up to change of basis on if tr tr for all the trace also plays central role in the distribution of quadratic forms
lie algebra the trace is map of lie algebras tr from the lie algebra of linear operators on an dimensional space matrices with entries in to the lie algebra of scalars as is abelian the lie bracket vanishes the fact that this is map of lie algebras is exactly the statement that the trace of bracket vanishes the kernel of this map matrix whose trace is zero is often said to be traceless or trace free and these matrices form the simple lie algebra which is the lie algebra of the special linear group of matrices with determinant the special linear group consists of the matrices which do not change volume while the special linear lie algebra is the matrices which do not alter volume of infinitesimal sets
in fact there is an internal direct sum decomposition of operators matrices into traceless operators matrices and scalars operators matrices
the projection map onto scalar operators can be expressed in terms of the trace concretely as formally one can compose the trace the counit map with the unit map of inclusion of scalars to obtain map mapping onto scalars and multiplying by dividing by makes this projection yielding the formula above
in terms of short exact sequences one has which is analogous to where for lie groups
however the trace splits naturally via times scalars so but the splitting of the determinant would be as the nth root times scalars and this does not in general define function so the determinant does not split and the general linear group does not decompose bilinear forms the bilinear form where are square matrices is called the killing form which is used for the classification of lie algebras
the trace defines bilinear form the form is symmetric non degenerate and associative in the sense that for complex simple lie algebra such as every such bilinear form is proportional to each other in particular to the killing form
two matrices and are said to be trace orthogonal if there is generalization to general representation of lie algebra such that is homomorphism of lie algebras end
the trace form tr on end is defined as above
the bilinear form is symmetric and invariant due to cyclicity
generalizations the concept of trace of matrix is generalized to the trace class of compact operators on hilbert spaces and the analog of the frobenius norm is called the hilbert schmidt norm
if is trace class operator then for any orthonormal basis the trace is given by and is finite and independent of the orthonormal basis the partial trace is another generalization of the trace that is operator valued
the trace of linear operator which lives on product space is equal to the partial traces over and for more properties and generalization of the partial trace see traced monoidal categories
if is general associative algebra over field then trace on is often defined to be any map tr which vanishes on commutators tr for all such trace is not uniquely defined it can always at least be modified by multiplication by nonzero scalar
supertrace is the generalization of trace to the setting of superalgebras
the operation of tensor contraction generalizes the trace to arbitrary tensors
traces in the language of tensor products given vector space there is natural bilinear map given by sending to the scalar
the universal property of the tensor product automatically implies that this bilinear map is induced by linear functional on similarly there is natural bilinear map hom given by sending to the linear map the universal property of the tensor product just as used previously says that this bilinear map is induced by linear map hom
if is finite dimensional then this linear map is linear isomorphism
this fundamental fact is straightforward consequence of the existence of finite basis of and can also be phrased as saying that any linear map can be written as the sum of finitely many rank one linear maps
composing the inverse of the isomorphism with the linear functional obtained above results in linear functional on hom
this linear functional is exactly the same as the trace
using the definition of trace as the sum of diagonal elements the matrix formula tr ab tr ba is straightforward to prove and was given above
in the present perspective one is considering linear maps and and viewing them as sums of rank one maps so that there are linear functionals and and nonzero vectors vi and wj such that vi and wj for any in then for any in the rank one linear map wj vi has trace vi wj and so tr
following the same procedure with and reversed one finds exactly the same formula proving that tr equals tr
the above proof can be regarded as being based upon tensor products given that the fundamental identity of end with is equivalent to the expressibility of any linear map as the sum of rank one linear maps
as such the proof may be written in the notation of tensor products
then one may consider the multilinear map given by sending to further composition with the trace map then results in and this is unchanged if one were to have started with instead
one may also consider the bilinear map end end end given by sending to the composition which is then induced by linear map end end end
it can be seen that this coincides with the linear map
the established symmetry upon composition with the trace map then establishes the equality of the two traces for any finite dimensional vector space there is natural linear map in the language of linear maps it assigns to scalar the linear map idv
sometimes this is called coevaluation map and the trace is called evaluation map
these structures can be axiomatized to define categorical traces in the abstract setting of category theory

principal component analysis pca is popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing high number of dimensions features per observation increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data
formally pca is statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of dataset
this is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into new coordinate system where most of the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data
many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points
principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics microbiome studies and atmospheric science
the principal components of collection of points in real coordinate space are sequence of unit vectors where the th vector is the direction of line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first vectors
here best fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line
these directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated
principal component analysis pca is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform change of basis on the data sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest
in data analysis the first principal component of set of variables presumed to be jointly normally distributed is the derived variable formed as linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance
the second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed and we may proceed through iterations until all the variance is explained
pca is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set
pca is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models
it is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower dimensional data while preserving as much of the data variation as possible
the first principal component can equivalently be defined as direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data
the th principal component can be taken as direction orthogonal to the first principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data
for either objective it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix
thus the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix
pca is the simplest of the true eigenvector based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis
factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of slightly different matrix
pca is also related to canonical correlation analysis cca
cca defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross covariance between two datasets while pca defines new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in single dataset
robust and norm based variants of standard pca have also been proposed
history pca was invented in by karl pearson as an analogue of the principal axis theorem in mechanics it was later independently developed and named by harold hotelling in the
depending on the field of application it is also named the discrete karhunen lo ve transform klt in signal processing the hotelling transform in multivariate quality control proper orthogonal decomposition pod in mechanical engineering singular value decomposition svd of invented in the last quarter of the th century eigenvalue decomposition evd of xtx in linear algebra factor analysis for discussion of the differences between pca and factor analysis see ch
of jolliffe principal component analysis eckart young theorem harman or empirical orthogonal functions eof in meteorological science empirical eigenfunction decomposition sirovich empirical component analysis lorenz quasiharmonic modes brooks et al spectral decomposition in noise and vibration and empirical modal analysis in structural dynamics
intuition pca can be thought of as fitting dimensional ellipsoid to the data where each axis of the ellipsoid represents principal component
if some axis of the ellipsoid is small then the variance along that axis is also small
to find the axes of the ellipsoid we must first center the values of each variable in the dataset on by subtracting the mean of the variable observed values from each of those values
these transformed values are used instead of the original observed values for each of the variables
then we compute the covariance matrix of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix
then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to turn them into unit vectors
once this is done each of the mutually orthogonal unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data
this choice of basis will transform the covariance matrix into diagonalized form in which the diagonal elements represent the variance of each axis
the proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues
biplots and scree plots degree of explained variance are used to explain findings of the pca
details pca is defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate called the first principal component the second greatest variance on the second coordinate and so on consider an data matrix with column wise zero empirical mean the sample mean of each column has been shifted to zero where each of the rows represents different repetition of the experiment and each of the columns gives particular kind of feature say the results from particular sensor
mathematically the transformation is defined by set of size of dimensional vectors of weights or coefficients that map each row vector of to new vector of principal component scores given by in such way that the individual variables of considered over the data set successively inherit the maximum possible variance from with each coefficient vector constrained to be unit vector where is usually selected to be strictly less than to reduce dimensionality
first component in order to maximize variance the first weight vector thus has to satisfy arg max arg max equivalently writing this in matrix form gives arg max arg max since has been defined to be unit vector it equivalently also satisfies arg max the quantity to be maximised can be recognised as rayleigh quotient
standard result for positive semidefinite matrix such as xtx is that the quotient maximum possible value is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix which occurs when is the corresponding eigenvector
with found the first principal component of data vector can then be given as score in the transformed co ordinates or as the corresponding vector in the original variables
further components the th component can be found by subtracting the first principal components from and then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix arg max it turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of xtx with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues
thus the weight vectors are eigenvectors of xtx
the th principal component of data vector can therefore be given as score tk in the transformed coordinates or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables where is the kth eigenvector of xtx
the full principal components decomposition of can therefore be given as where is by matrix of weights whose columns are the eigenvectors of xtx
the transpose of is sometimes called the whitening or sphering transformation
columns of multiplied by the square root of corresponding eigenvalues that is eigenvectors scaled up by the variances are called loadings in pca or in factor analysis
covariances xtx itself can be recognized as proportional to the empirical sample covariance matrix of the dataset xt
the sample covariance between two of the different principal components over the dataset is given by where the eigenvalue property of has been used to move from line to line however eigenvectors and corresponding to eigenvalues of symmetric matrix are orthogonal if the eigenvalues are different or can be orthogonalised if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value
the product in the final line is therefore zero there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset
another way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix
in matrix form the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be written the empirical covariance matrix between the principal components becomes where is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of xtx
is equal to the sum of the squares over the dataset associated with each component that is tk
dimensionality reduction the transformation maps data vector from an original space of variables to new space of variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset
however not all the principal components need to be kept
keeping only the first principal components produced by using only the first eigenvectors gives the truncated transformation where the matrix tl now has rows but only columns
in other words pca learns linear transformation where the columns of matrix form an orthogonal basis for the features the components of representation that are decorrelated
by construction of all the transformed data matrices with only columns this score matrix maximises the variance in the original data that has been preserved while minimising the total squared reconstruction error or such dimensionality reduction can be very useful step for visualising and processing high dimensional datasets while still retaining as much of the variance in the dataset as possible
for example selecting and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two dimensional plane through the high dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out so if the data contains clusters these too may be most spread out and therefore most visible to be plotted out in two dimensional diagram whereas if two directions through the data or two of the original variables are chosen at random the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other making them indistinguishable
similarly in regression analysis the larger the number of explanatory variables allowed the greater is the chance of overfitting the model producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets
one approach especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables is to reduce them to few principal components and then run the regression against them method called principal component regression
dimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in dataset are noisy
if each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed gaussian noise then the columns of will also contain similarly identically distributed gaussian noise such distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix which can be thought of as high dimensional rotation of the co ordinate axes
however with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance the proportionate effect of the noise is less the first few components achieve higher signal to noise ratio
pca thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction while the later principal components may be dominated by noise and so disposed of without great loss
if the dataset is not too large the significance of the principal components can be tested using parametric bootstrap as an aid in determining how many principal components to retain
singular value decomposition the principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization the singular value decomposition svd of here is an by rectangular diagonal matrix of positive numbers called the singular values of is an by matrix the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length called the left singular vectors of and is by whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length and called the right singular vectors of in terms of this factorization the matrix xtx can be written where is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values of and the excess zeros chopped off that satisfies comparison with the eigenvector factorization of xtx establishes that the right singular vectors of are equivalent to the eigenvectors of xtx while the singular values of are equal to the square root of the eigenvalues of xtx
using the singular value decomposition the score matrix can be written so each column of is given by one of the left singular vectors of multiplied by the corresponding singular value
this form is also the polar decomposition of efficient algorithms exist to calculate the svd of without having to form the matrix xtx so computing the svd is now the standard way to calculate principal components analysis from data matrix unless only handful of components are required
as with the eigen decomposition truncated score matrix tl can be obtained by considering only the first largest singular values and their singular vectors the truncation of matrix or using truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of rank to the original matrix in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible frobenius norm result known as the eckart young theorem
further considerations the singular values in are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix xtx
each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the variance more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean that is associated with each eigenvector
the sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean
pca essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components
this moves as much of the variance as possible using an orthogonal transformation into the first few dimensions
the values in the remaining dimensions therefore tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information see below
pca is often used in this manner for dimensionality reduction
pca has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest variance as defined above
this advantage however comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared for example and when applicable to the discrete cosine transform and in particular to the dct ii which is simply known as the dct
nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than pca
pca is sensitive to the scaling of the variables
if we have just two variables and they have the same sample variance and are completely correlated then the pca will entail rotation by and the weights they are the cosines of rotation for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal
but if we multiply all values of the first variable by then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable with small contribution from the other variable whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable
this means that whenever the different variables have different units like temperature and mass pca is somewhat arbitrary method of analysis
different results would be obtained if one used fahrenheit rather than celsius for example
pearson original paper was entitled on lines and planes of closest fit to systems of points in space in space implies physical euclidean space where such concerns do not arise
one way of making the pca less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as basis for pca
however this compresses or expands the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance
mean centering is necessary for performing classical pca to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance
if mean subtraction is not performed the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data
mean of zero is needed for finding basis that minimizes the mean square error of the approximation of the data mean centering is unnecessary if performing principal components analysis on correlation matrix as the data are already centered after calculating correlations
correlations are derived from the cross product of two standard scores scores or statistical moments hence the name pearson product moment correlation
also see the article by kromrey foster johnson on mean centering in moderated regression much ado about nothing
since covariances are correlations of normalized variables or standard scores pca based on the correlation matrix of is equal to pca based on the covariance matrix of the standardized version of pca is popular primary technique in pattern recognition
it is not however optimized for class separability
however it has been used to quantify the distance between two or more classes by calculating center of mass for each class in principal component space and reporting euclidean distance between center of mass of two or more classes
the linear discriminant analysis is an alternative which is optimized for class separability
table of symbols and abbreviations properties and limitations of pca properties some properties of pca include property for any integer consider the orthogonal linear transformation where is element vector and is matrix and let be the variance covariance matrix for then the trace of denoted tr is maximized by taking where consists of the first columns of is the transpose of property consider again the orthonormal transformation with and defined as before
then tr is minimized by taking where consists of the last columns of the statistical implication of this property is that the last few pcs are not simply unstructured left overs after removing the important pcs
because these last pcs have variances as small as possible they are useful in their own right
they can help to detect unsuspected near constant linear relationships between the elements of and they may also be useful in regression in selecting subset of variables from and in outlier detection
property spectral decomposition of before we look at its usage we first look at diagonal elements var then perhaps the main statistical implication of the result is that not only can we decompose the combined variances of all the elements of into decreasing contributions due to each pc but we can also decompose the whole covariance matrix into contributions from each pc
although not strictly decreasing the elements of will tend to become smaller as increases as is nonincreasing for increasing whereas the elements of tend to stay about the same size because of the normalization constraints limitations as noted above the results of pca depend on the scaling of the variables
this can be cured by scaling each feature by its standard deviation so that one ends up with dimensionless features with unital variance the applicability of pca as described above is limited by certain tacit assumptions made in its derivation
in particular pca can capture linear correlations between the features but fails when this assumption is violated see figure in the reference
in some cases coordinate transformations can restore the linearity assumption and pca can then be applied see kernel pca
another limitation is the mean removal process before constructing the covariance matrix for pca
in fields such as astronomy all the signals are non negative and the mean removal process will force the mean of some astrophysical exposures to be zero which consequently creates unphysical negative fluxes and forward modeling has to be performed to recover the true magnitude of the signals
as an alternative method non negative matrix factorization focusing only on the non negative elements in the matrices which is well suited for astrophysical observations
see more at relation between pca and non negative matrix factorization
pca is at disadvantage if the data has not been standardized before applying the algorithm to it
pca transforms original data into data that is relevant to the principal components of that data which means that the new data variables cannot be interpreted in the same ways that the originals were
they are linear interpretations of the original variables
also if pca is not performed properly there is high likelihood of information loss pca relies on linear model
if dataset has pattern hidden inside it that is nonlinear then pca can actually steer the analysis in the complete opposite direction of progress
researchers at kansas state university discovered that the sampling error in their experiments impacted the bias of pca results
if the number of subjects or blocks is smaller than and or the researcher is interested in pc beyond the first it may be better to first correct for the serial correlation before pca is conducted
the researchers at kansas state also found that pca could be seriously biased if the autocorrelation structure of the data is not correctly handled
pca and information theory dimensionality reduction results in loss of information in general
pca based dimensionality reduction tends to minimize that information loss under certain signal and noise models
under the assumption that that is that the data vector is the sum of the desired information bearing signal and noise signal one can show that pca can be optimal for dimensionality reduction from an information theoretic point of view
in particular linsker showed that if is gaussian and is gaussian noise with covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix the pca maximizes the mutual information between the desired information and the dimensionality reduced output if the noise is still gaussian and has covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix that is the components of the vector are iid but the information bearing signal is non gaussian which is common scenario pca at least minimizes an upper bound on the information loss which is defined as
the optimality of pca is also preserved if the noise is iid and at least more gaussian in terms of the kullback leibler divergence than the information bearing signal in general even if the above signal model holds pca loses its information theoretic optimality as soon as the noise becomes dependent
computing pca using the covariance method the following is detailed description of pca using the covariance method see also here as opposed to the correlation method the goal is to transform given data set of dimension to an alternative data set of smaller dimension equivalently we are seeking to find the matrix where is the karhunen lo ve transform klt of matrix organize the data setsuppose you have data comprising set of observations of variables and you want to reduce the data so that each observation can be described with only variables suppose further that the data are arranged as set of data vectors with each representing single grouped observation of the variables
write as row vectors each with elements
place the row vectors into single matrix of dimensions calculate the empirical meanfind the empirical mean along each column place the calculated mean values into an empirical mean vector of dimensions calculate the deviations from the meanmean subtraction is an integral part of the solution towards finding principal component basis that minimizes the mean square error of approximating the data
hence we proceed by centering the data as follows subtract the empirical mean vector from each row of the data matrix store mean subtracted data in the matrix where is an column vector of all for in some applications each variable column of may also be scaled to have variance equal to see score
this step affects the calculated principal components but makes them independent of the units used to measure the different variables
find the covariance matrixfind the empirical covariance matrix from matrix where is the conjugate transpose operator
if consists entirely of real numbers which is the case in many applications the conjugate transpose is the same as the regular transpose
the reasoning behind using instead of to calculate the covariance is bessel correction find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrixcompute the matrix of eigenvectors which diagonalizes the covariance matrix where is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of this step will typically involve the use of computer based algorithm for computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues
these algorithms are readily available as sub components of most matrix algebra systems such as sas matlab mathematica scipy idl interactive data language or gnu octave as well as opencv
matrix will take the form of an diagonal matrix where is the jth eigenvalue of the covariance matrix and matrix also of dimension contains column vectors each of length which represent the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are ordered and paired
the jth eigenvalue corresponds to the jth eigenvector
matrix denotes the matrix of right eigenvectors as opposed to left eigenvectors
in general the matrix of right eigenvectors need not be the conjugate transpose of the matrix of left eigenvectors rearrange the eigenvectors and eigenvaluessort the columns of the eigenvector matrix and eigenvalue matrix in order of decreasing eigenvalue
make sure to maintain the correct pairings between the columns in each matrix compute the cumulative energy content for each eigenvectorthe eigenvalues represent the distribution of the source data energy among each of the eigenvectors where the eigenvectors form basis for the data
the cumulative energy content for the jth eigenvector is the sum of the energy content across all of the eigenvalues from through for select subset of the eigenvectors as basis vectorssave the first columns of as the matrix where use the vector as guide in choosing an appropriate value for the goal is to choose value of as small as possible while achieving reasonably high value of on percentage basis
for example you may want to choose so that the cumulative energy is above certain threshold like percent
in this case choose the smallest value of such that project the data onto the new basisthe projected data points are the rows of the matrix that is the first column of is the projection of the data points onto the first principal component the second column is the projection onto the second principal component etc
derivation of pca using the covariance method let be dimensional random vector expressed as column vector
without loss of generality assume has zero mean
we want to find orthonormal transformation matrix so that px has diagonal covariance matrix that is px is random vector with all its distinct components pairwise uncorrelated
quick computation assuming were unitary yields cov cov hence holds if and only if cov were diagonalisable by this is very constructive as cov is guaranteed to be non negative definite matrix and thus is guaranteed to be diagonalisable by some unitary matrix
covariance free computation in practical implementations especially with high dimensional data large the naive covariance method is rarely used because it is not efficient due to high computational and memory costs of explicitly determining the covariance matrix
the covariance free approach avoids the np operations of explicitly calculating and storing the covariance matrix xtx instead utilizing one of matrix free methods for example based on the function evaluating the product xt at the cost of np operations
iterative computation one way to compute the first principal component efficiently is shown in the following pseudo code for data matrix with zero mean without ever computing its covariance matrix
random vector of length norm do times vector of length for each row in rts is the eigenvalue error norm exit if error tolerance return this power iteration algorithm simply calculates the vector xt normalizes and places the result back in the eigenvalue is approximated by rt xtx which is the rayleigh quotient on the unit vector for the covariance matrix xtx
if the largest singular value is well separated from the next largest one the vector gets close to the first principal component of within the number of iterations which is small relative to at the total cost cnp
the power iteration convergence can be accelerated without noticeably sacrificing the small cost per iteration using more advanced matrix free methods such as the lanczos algorithm or the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient lobpcg method
subsequent principal components can be computed one by one via deflation or simultaneously as block
in the former approach imprecisions in already computed approximate principal components additively affect the accuracy of the subsequently computed principal components thus increasing the error with every new computation
the latter approach in the block power method replaces single vectors and with block vectors matrices and every column of approximates one of the leading principal components while all columns are iterated simultaneously
the main calculation is evaluation of the product xt
implemented for example in lobpcg efficient blocking eliminates the accumulation of the errors allows using high level blas matrix matrix product functions and typically leads to faster convergence compared to the single vector one by one technique
the nipals method non linear iterative partial least squares nipals is variant the classical power iteration with matrix deflation by subtraction implemented for computing the first few components in principal component or partial least squares analysis
for very high dimensional datasets such as those generated in the omics sciences for example genomics metabolomics it is usually only necessary to compute the first few pcs
the non linear iterative partial least squares nipals algorithm updates iterative approximations to the leading scores and loadings and by the power iteration multiplying on every iteration by on the left and on the right that is calculation of the covariance matrix is avoided just as in the matrix free implementation of the power iterations to xtx based on the function evaluating the product xt tx the matrix deflation by subtraction is performed by subtracting the outer product from leaving the deflated residual matrix used to calculate the subsequent leading pcs
for large data matrices or matrices that have high degree of column collinearity nipals suffers from loss of orthogonality of pcs due to machine precision round off errors accumulated in each iteration and matrix deflation by subtraction
gram schmidt re orthogonalization algorithm is applied to both the scores and the loadings at each iteration step to eliminate this loss of orthogonality
nipals reliance on single vector multiplications cannot take advantage of high level blas and results in slow convergence for clustered leading singular values both these deficiencies are resolved in more sophisticated matrix free block solvers such as the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient lobpcg method
online sequential estimation in an online or streaming situation with data arriving piece by piece rather than being stored in single batch it is useful to make an estimate of the pca projection that can be updated sequentially
this can be done efficiently but requires different algorithms
pca and qualitative variables in pca it is common that we want to introduce qualitative variables as supplementary elements
for example many quantitative variables have been measured on plants
for these plants some qualitative variables are available as for example the species to which the plant belongs
these data were subjected to pca for quantitative variables
when analyzing the results it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable species
for this the following results are produced
identification on the factorial planes of the different species for example using different colors
representation on the factorial planes of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species
for each center of gravity and each axis value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin these results are what is called introducing qualitative variable as supplementary element
this procedure is detailed in and husson pag and pag few software offer this option in an automatic way
this is the case of spad that historically following the work of ludovic lebart was the first to propose this option and the package factominer
applications intelligence the earliest application of factor analysis was in locating and measuring components of human intelligence
it was believed that intelligence had various uncorrelated components such as spatial intelligence verbal intelligence induction deduction etc and that scores on these could be adduced by factor analysis from results on various tests to give single index known as the intelligence quotient iq
the pioneering statistical psychologist spearman actually developed factor analysis in for his two factor theory of intelligence adding formal technique to the science of psychometrics
in thurstone looked for factors of intelligence developing the notion of mental age
standard iq tests today are based on this early work
residential differentiation in shevky and williams introduced the theory of factorial ecology which dominated studies of residential differentiation from the to the
neighbourhoods in city were recognizable or could be distinguished from one another by various characteristics which could be reduced to three by factor analysis
these were known as social rank an index of occupational status familism or family size and ethnicity cluster analysis could then be applied to divide the city into clusters or precincts according to values of the three key factor variables
an extensive literature developed around factorial ecology in urban geography but the approach went out of fashion after as being methodologically primitive and having little place in postmodern geographical paradigms
one of the problems with factor analysis has always been finding convincing names for the various artificial factors
in flood revived the factorial ecology approach to show that principal components analysis actually gave meaningful answers directly without resorting to factor rotation
the principal components were actually dual variables or shadow prices of forces pushing people together or apart in cities
the first component was accessibility the classic trade off between demand for travel and demand for space around which classical urban economics is based
the next two components were disadvantage which keeps people of similar status in separate neighbourhoods mediated by planning and ethnicity where people of similar ethnic backgrounds try to co locate about the same time the australian bureau of statistics defined distinct indexes of advantage and disadvantage taking the first principal component of sets of key variables that were thought to be important
these seifa indexes are regularly published for various jurisdictions and are used frequently in spatial analysis
development indexes pca has been the only formal method available for the development of indexes which are otherwise hit or miss ad hoc undertaking
the city development index was developed by pca from about indicators of city outcomes in survey of global cities
the first principal component was subject to iterative regression adding the original variables singly until about of its variation was accounted for
the index ultimately used about indicators but was good predictor of many more variables
its comparative value agreed very well with subjective assessment of the condition of each city
the coefficients on items of infrastructure were roughly proportional to the average costs of providing the underlying services suggesting the index was actually measure of effective physical and social investment in the city
the country level human development index hdi from undp which has been published since and is very extensively used in development studies has very similar coefficients on similar indicators strongly suggesting it was originally constructed using pca
population genetics in cavalli sforza and others pioneered the use of principal components analysis pca to summarise data on variation in human gene frequencies across regions
the components showed distinctive patterns including gradients and sinusoidal waves
they interpreted these patterns as resulting from specific ancient migration events
since then pca has been ubiquitous in population genetics with thousands of papers using pca as display mechanism
genetics varies largely according to proximity so the first two principal components actually show spatial distribution and may be used to map the relative geographical location of different population groups thereby showing individuals who have wandered from their original locations pca in genetics has been technically controversial in that the technique has been performed on discrete non normal variables and often on binary allele markers
the lack of any measures of standard error in pca are also an impediment to more consistent usage
in august the molecular biologist eran elhaik published theoretical paper in scientific reports analyzing pca applications
he concluded that it was easy to manipulate the method which in his view generated results that were erroneous contradictory and absurd
specifically he argued the results achieved in population genetics were characterized by cherry picking and circular reasoning
market research and indexes of attitude market research has been an extensive user of pca
it is used to develop customer satisfaction or customer loyalty scores for products and with clustering to develop market segments that may be targeted with advertising campaigns in much the same way as factorial ecology will locate geographical areas with similar characteristics pca rapidly transforms large amounts of data into smaller easier to digest variables that can be more rapidly and readily analyzed
in any consumer questionnaire there are series of questions designed to elicit consumer attitudes and principal components seek out latent variables underlying these attitudes
for example the oxford internet survey in asked people about their attitudes and beliefs and from these analysts extracted four principal component dimensions which they identified as escape social networking efficiency and problem creating another example from joe flood in extracted an attitudinal index toward housing from attitude questions in national survey of households in australia
the first principal component represented general attitude toward property and home ownership
the index or the attitude questions it embodied could be fed into general linear model of tenure choice
the strongest determinant of private renting by far was the attitude index rather than income marital status or household type
quantitative finance in quantitative finance principal component analysis can be directly applied to the risk management of interest rate derivative portfolios
trading multiple swap instruments which are usually function of other market quotable swap instruments is sought to be reduced to usually or principal components representing the path of interest rates on macro basis
converting risks to be represented as those to factor loadings or multipliers provides assessments and understanding beyond that available to simply collectively viewing risks to individual buckets
pca has also been applied to equity portfolios in similar fashion both to portfolio risk and to risk return
one application is to reduce portfolio risk where allocation strategies are applied to the principal portfolios instead of the underlying stocks
second is to enhance portfolio return using the principal components to select stocks with upside potential
neuroscience variant of principal components analysis is used in neuroscience to identify the specific properties of stimulus that increases neuron probability of generating an action potential
this technique is known as spike triggered covariance analysis
in typical application an experimenter presents white noise process as stimulus usually either as sensory input to test subject or as current injected directly into the neuron and records train of action potentials or spikes produced by the neuron as result
presumably certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike
in order to extract these features the experimenter calculates the covariance matrix of the spike triggered ensemble the set of all stimuli defined and discretized over finite time window typically on the order of ms that immediately preceded spike
the eigenvectors of the difference between the spike triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the prior stimulus ensemble the set of all stimuli defined over the same length time window then indicate the directions in the space of stimuli along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble
specifically the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the varince of the prior
since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to spike they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features
in neuroscience pca is also used to discern the identity of neuron from the shape of its action potential
spike sorting is an important procedure because extracellular recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron
in spike sorting one first uses pca to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms and then performs clustering analysis to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons
pca as dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles
it has been used in determining collective variables that is order parameters during phase transitions in the brain
relation with other methods correspondence analysis correspondence analysis ca was developed by jean paul benz cri and is conceptually similar to pca but scales the data which should be non negative so that rows and columns are treated equivalently
it is traditionally applied to contingency tables
ca decomposes the chi squared statistic associated to this table into orthogonal factors
because ca is descriptive technique it can be applied to tables for which the chi squared statistic is appropriate or not
several variants of ca are available including detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis
one special extension is multiple correspondence analysis which may be seen as the counterpart of principal component analysis for categorical data
factor analysis principal component analysis creates variables that are linear combinations of the original variables
the new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal
the pca transformation can be helpful as pre processing step before clustering
pca is variance focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable
pca is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction that is translating variable space into optimal factor space but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors
factor analysis is similar to principal component analysis in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables
different from pca factor analysis is correlation focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter correlations among variables in which the factors represent the common variance of variables excluding unique variance
in terms of the correlation matrix this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off diagonal terms that is shared co variance while pca focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal
however as side result when trying to reproduce the on diagonal terms pca also tends to fit relatively well the off diagonal correlations
results given by pca and factor analysis are very similar in most situations but this is not always the case and there are some problems where the results are significantly different
factor analysis is generally used when the research purpose is detecting data structure that is latent constructs or factors or causal modeling
if the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met then factor analysis will give erroneous results
means clustering it has been asserted that the relaxed solution of means clustering specified by the cluster indicators is given by the principal components and the pca subspace spanned by the principal directions is identical to the cluster centroid subspace
however that pca is useful relaxation of means clustering was not new result and it is straightforward to uncover counterexamples to the statement that the cluster centroid subspace is spanned by the principal directions
non negative matrix factorization non negative matrix factorization nmf is dimension reduction method where only non negative elements in the matrices are used which is therefore promising method in astronomy in the sense that astrophysical signals are non negative
the pca components are orthogonal to each other while the nmf components are all non negative and therefore constructs non orthogonal basis
in pca the contribution of each component is ranked based on the magnitude of its corresponding eigenvalue which is equivalent to the fractional residual variance frv in analyzing empirical data
for nmf its components are ranked based only on the empirical frv curves
the residual fractional eigenvalue plots that is as function of component number given total of components for pca has flat plateau where no data is captured to remove the quasi static noise then the curves dropped quickly as an indication of over fitting and captures random noise
the frv curves for nmf is decreasing continuously when the nmf components are constructed sequentially indicating the continuous capturing of quasi static noise then converge to higher levels than pca indicating the less over fitting property of nmf
iconography of correlations it is often difficult to interpret the principal components when the data include many variables of various origins or when some variables are qualitative
this leads the pca user to delicate elimination of several variables
if observations or variables have an excessive impact on the direction of the axes they should be removed and then projected as supplementary elements
in addition it is necessary to avoid interpreting the proximities between the points close to the center of the factorial plane
the iconography of correlations on the contrary which is not projection on system of axes does not have these drawbacks
we can therefore keep all the variables
the principle of the diagram is to underline the remarkable correlations of the correlation matrix by solid line positive correlation or dotted line negative correlation
strong correlation is not remarkable if it is not direct but caused by the effect of third variable
conversely weak correlations can be remarkable
for example if variable depends on several independent variables the correlations of with each of them are weak and yet remarkable
generalizations sparse pca particular disadvantage of pca is that the principal components are usually linear combinations of all input variables
sparse pca overcomes this disadvantage by finding linear combinations that contain just few input variables
it extends the classic method of principal component analysis pca for the reduction of dimensionality of data by adding sparsity constraint on the input variables
several approaches have been proposed including regression framework convex relaxation semidefinite programming framework generalized power method framework an alternating maximization framework forward backward greedy search and exact methods using branch and bound techniques bayesian formulation framework the methodological and theoretical developments of sparse pca as well as its applications in scientific studies were recently reviewed in survey paper
nonlinear pca most of the modern methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction find their theoretical and algorithmic roots in pca or means
pearson original idea was to take straight line or plane which will be the best fit to set of data points
trevor hastie expanded on this concept by proposing principal curves as the natural extension for the geometric interpretation of pca which explicitly constructs manifold for data approximation followed by projecting the points onto it as is illustrated by fig
see also the elastic map algorithm and principal geodesic analysis
another popular generalization is kernel pca which corresponds to pca performed in reproducing kernel hilbert space associated with positive definite kernel
in multilinear subspace learning pca is generalized to multilinear pca mpca that extracts features directly from tensor representations
mpca is solved by performing pca in each mode of the tensor iteratively
mpca has been applied to face recognition gait recognition etc
mpca is further extended to uncorrelated mpca non negative mpca and robust mpca
way principal component analysis may be performed with models such as tucker decomposition parafac multiple factor analysis co inertia analysis statis and distatis
robust pca while pca finds the mathematically optimal method as in minimizing the squared error it is still sensitive to outliers in the data that produce large errors something that the method tries to avoid in the first place
it is therefore common practice to remove outliers before computing pca
however in some contexts outliers can be difficult to identify
for example in data mining algorithms like correlation clustering the assignment of points to clusters and outliers is not known beforehand
recently proposed generalization of pca based on weighted pca increases robustness by assigning different weights to data objects based on their estimated relevancy
outlier resistant variants of pca have also been proposed based on norm formulations pca robust principal component analysis rpca via decomposition in low rank and sparse matrices is modification of pca that works well with respect to grossly corrupted observations
similar techniques independent component analysis independent component analysis ica is directed to similar problems as principal component analysis but finds additively separable components rather than successive approximations
network component analysis given matrix it tries to decompose it into two matrices such that key difference from techniques such as pca and ica is that some of the entries of are constrained to be here is termed the regulatory layer
while in general such decomposition can have multiple solutions they prove that if the following conditions are satisfied has full column rank each column of must have at least zeroes where is the number of columns of or alternatively the number of rows of
the justification for this criterion is that if node is removed from the regulatory layer along with all the output nodes connected to it the result must still be characterized by connectivity matrix with full column rank
must have full row rank then the decomposition is unique up to multiplication by scalar
discriminant analysis of principal components discriminant analysis of principal components dapc is multivariate method used to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals
genetic variation is partitioned into two components variation between groups and within groups and it maximizes the former
linear discriminants are linear combinations of alleles which best separate the clusters
alleles that most contribute to this discrimination are therefore those that are the most markedly different across groups
the contributions of alleles to the groupings identified by dapc can allow identifying regions of the genome driving the genetic divergence among groups in dapc data is first transformed using principal components analysis pca and subsequently clusters are identified using discriminant analysis da

in mathematics matrix norm is vector norm in vector space whose elements vectors are matrices of given dimensions
preliminaries given field of either real or complex numbers let be the vector space of matrices with rows and columns and entries in the field matrix norm is norm on this article will always write such norms with double vertical bars like so
thus the matrix norm is function that must satisfy the following properties for all scalars and matrices positive valued definite absolutely homogeneous sub additive or satisfying the triangle inequality the only feature distinguishing matrices from rearranged vectors is multiplication
matrix norms are particularly useful if they are also sub multiplicative every norm on kn can be rescaled to be sub multiplicative in some books the terminology matrix norm is reserved for sub multiplicative norms
matrix norms induced by vector norms suppose vector norm on and vector norm on are given
any matrix induces linear operator from to with respect to the standard basis and one defines the corresponding induced norm or operator norm or subordinate norm on the space of all matrices as follows where sup denotes the supremum
this norm measures how much the mapping induced by can stretch vectors
depending on the vector norms used notation other than can be used for the operator norm
matrix norms induced by vector norms if the norm for vectors is used for both spaces and then the corresponding operator norm is these induced norms are different from the entry wise norms and the schatten norms for matrices treated below which are also usually denoted by in the special cases of the induced matrix norms can be computed or estimated by which is simply the maximum absolute column sum of the matrix which is simply the maximum absolute row sum of the matrix
in the special case of the euclidean norm or norm for vectors the induced matrix norm is the spectral norm
the two values do not coincide in infinite dimensions see spectral radius for further discussion
the spectral norm of matrix is the largest singular value of the square root of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix where denotes the conjugate transpose of where max represents the largest singular value of matrix also since max max and similarly by singular value decomposition svd
there is another important inequality where is the frobenius norm
equality holds if and only if the matrix is rank one matrix or zero matrix
this inequality can be derived from the fact that the trace of matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues
when we have an equivalent definition for as sup with
it can be shown to be equivalent to the above definitions using the cauchy schwarz inequality
for example for we have that properties any operator norm is consistent with the vector norms that induce it giving suppose and are operator norms induced by the respective pairs of vector norms and
then this follows from and square matrices suppose is an operator norm on the space of square matrices induced by vector norms and then the operator norm is sub multiplicative matrix norm moreover any such norm satisfies the inequality for all positive integers where is the spectral radius of for symmetric or hermitian we have equality in for the norm since in this case the norm is precisely the spectral radius of for an arbitrary matrix we may not have equality for any norm counterexample would be which has vanishing spectral radius
in any case for any matrix norm we have the spectral radius formula consistent and compatible norms matrix norm on is called consistent with vector norm on and vector norm on if for all and all in the special case of and is also called compatible with all induced norms are consistent by definition
also any sub multiplicative matrix norm on induces compatible vector norm on by defining
entry wise matrix norms these norms treat an matrix as vector of size and use one of the familiar vector norms
for example using the norm for vectors we get this is different norm from the induced norm see above and the schatten norm see below but the notation is the same
the special case is the frobenius norm and yields the maximum norm
and lp norms let be the columns of matrix from the original definition the matrix presents data points in dimensional space
the norm is the sum of the euclidean norms of the columns of the matrix the norm as an error function is more robust since the error for each data point column is not squared
it is used in robust data analysis and sparse coding
for the norm can be generalized to the norm as follows
frobenius norm when for the norm it is called the frobenius norm or the hilbert schmidt norm though the latter term is used more frequently in the context of operators on possibly infinite dimensional hilbert space
this norm can be defined in various ways trace min where are the singular values of recall that the trace function returns the sum of diagonal entries of square matrix
the frobenius norm is an extension of the euclidean norm to and comes from the frobenius inner product on the space of all matrices
the frobenius norm is sub multiplicative and is very useful for numerical linear algebra
the sub multiplicativity of frobenius norm can be proved using cauchy schwarz inequality
frobenius norm is often easier to compute than induced norms and has the useful property of being invariant under rotations and unitary operations in general
that is for any unitary matrix this property follows from the cyclic nature of the trace trace trace trace trace trace trace and analogously trace trace trace where we have used the unitary nature of that is
it also satisfies and where is the frobenius inner product and re is the real part of complex number irrelevant for real matrices max norm the max norm is the elementwise norm in the limit as goes to infinity max max
this norm is not sub multiplicative
note that in some literature such as communication complexity an alternative definition of max norm also called the norm refers to the factorization norm min min max schatten norms the schatten norms arise when applying the norm to the vector of singular values of matrix
if the singular values of the matrix are denoted by then the schatten norm is defined by min these norms again share the notation with the induced and entry wise norms but they are different
all schatten norms are sub multiplicative
they are also unitarily invariant which means that for all matrices and all unitary matrices and the most familiar cases are
the case yields the frobenius norm introduced before
the case yields the spectral norm which is the operator norm induced by the vector norm see above
finally yields the nuclear norm also known as the trace norm or the ky fan norm defined as trace min where denotes positive semidefinite matrix such that more precisely since is positive semidefinite matrix its square root is well defined
the nuclear norm is convex envelope of the rank function rank so it is often used in mathematical optimization to search for low rank matrices
monotone norms matrix norm is called monotone if it is monotonic with respect to the loewner order
thus matrix norm is increasing if
the frobenius norm and spectral norm are examples of monotone norms
cut norms another source of inspiration for matrix norms arises from considering matrix as the adjacency matrix of weighted directed graph
the so called cut norm measures how close the associated graph is to being bipartite where km
equivalent definitions up to constant factor impose the conditions or the cut norm is equivalent to the induced operator norm which is itself equivalent to the another norm called the grothendieck norm to define the grothendieck norm first note that linear operator is just scalar and thus extends to linear operator on any kk kk
moreover given any choice of basis for kn and km any linear operator kn km extends to linear operator kk kk by letting each matrix element on elements of kk via scalar multiplication
the grothendieck norm is the norm of that extended operator in symbols the grothendieck norm depends on choice of basis usually taken to be the standard basis and equivalence of norms for any two matrix norms and we have that for some positive numbers and for all matrices in other words all norms on are equivalent they induce the same topology on this is true because the vector space has the finite dimension moreover for every vector norm on there exists unique positive real number such that is sub multiplicative matrix norm for every sub multiplicative matrix norm is said to be minimal if there exists no other sub multiplicative matrix norm satisfying
examples of norm equivalence let once again refer to the norm induced by the vector norm as above in the induced norm section
for matrix of rank the following inequalities hold max max another useful inequality between matrix norms is which is special case of lder inequality

information is an abstract concept that refers to that which has the power to inform
at the most fundamental level information pertains to the interpretation of that which may be sensed
any natural process that is not completely random and any observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information
whereas digital signals and other data use discrete signs to convey information other phenomena and artifacts such as analog signals poems pictures music or other sounds and currents convey information in more continuous form
information is not knowledge itself but the meaning that may be derived from representation through interpretation information is often processed iteratively data available at one step are processed into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step
for example in written text each symbol or letter conveys information relevant to the word it is part of each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of and so on until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in given domain
in digital signal bits may be interpreted into the symbols letters numbers or structures that convey the information available at the next level up
the key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing
the concept of information is relevant in various contexts including those of constraint communication control data form education knowledge meaning understanding mental stimuli pattern perception proposition representation and entropy
the derivation of information from signal or message may be thought of as the resolution of ambiguity or uncertainty that arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message information may be structured as data
redundant data can be compressed up to an optimal size which is the theoretical limit of compression
the information available through collection of data may be derived by analysis
for example data may be collected from single customer order at restaurant
the information available from many orders may be analyzed and then becomes knowledge that is put to use when the business subsequently is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish information can be transmitted in time via data storage and space via communication and telecommunication
information is expressed either as the content of message or through direct or indirect observation
that which is perceived can be construed as message in its own right and in that sense all information is always conveyed as the content of message
information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation for example information may be encoded into sequence of signs or transmitted via signal
it can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication
the uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence
uncertainty is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence
information theory takes advantage of this by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty
the bit is typical unit of information
it is that which reduces uncertainty by half
other units such as the nat may be used
for example the information encoded in one fair coin flip is log bit and in two fair coin flips is log bits
science article estimated that of technologically stored information was already in digital bits in and that the year was the beginning of the digital age for information storage with digital storage capacity bypassing analog for the first time
etymology the english word information comes from middle french enformacion informacion information criminal investigation and its etymon latin informati conception teaching creation in english information is an uncountable mass noun
information theory information theory is the scientific study of the quantification storage and communication of information
the field was fundamentally established by the works of harry nyquist and ralph hartley in the and claude shannon in the
the field is at the intersection of probability theory statistics computer science statistical mechanics information engineering and electrical engineering
key measure in information theory is entropy
entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of random variable or the outcome of random process
for example identifying the outcome of fair coin flip with two equally likely outcomes provides less information lower entropy than specifying the outcome from roll of die with six equally likely outcomes
some other important measures in information theory are mutual information channel capacity error exponents and relative entropy
important sub fields of information theory include source coding algorithmic complexity theory algorithmic information theory and information theoretic security
there is another opinion regarding the universal definition of information
it lies in the fact that the concept itself has changed along with the change of various historical epochs and in order to find such definition it is necessary to find common features and patterns of this transformation
for example researchers in the field of information petrichenko and semenova based on retrospective analysis of changes in the concept of information give the following universal definition information is form of transmission of human experience knowledge
in their opinion the change in the essence of the concept of information occurs after various breakthrough technologies for the transfer of experience knowledge
the appearance of writing the printing press the first encyclopedias the telegraph the development of cybernetics the creation of microprocessor the internet smartphones etc
each new form of experience transfer is synthesis of the previous ones
that is why we see such variety of definitions of information because according to the law of dialectics negation negation all previous ideas about information are contained in filmed form and in its modern representation applications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding data compression
for zip files and channel coding error detection and correction
its impact has been crucial to the success of the voyager missions to deep space the invention of the compact disc the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the internet
the theory has also found applications in other areas including statistical inference cryptography neurobiology perception linguistics the evolution and function of molecular codes bioinformatics thermal physics quantum computing black holes information retrieval intelligence gathering plagiarism detection pattern recognition anomaly detection and even art creation
as sensory input often information can be viewed as type of input to an organism or system
inputs are of two kinds some inputs are important to the function of the organism for example food or system energy by themselves
in his book sensory ecology biophysicist david dusenbery called these causal inputs
other inputs information are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of causal input at later time and perhaps another place
some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be connection to causal input
in practice information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or system
for example light is mainly but not only
plants can grow in the direction of the lightsource causal input to plants but for animals it only provides information
the colored light reflected from flower is too weak for photosynthesis but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower where the bee often finds nectar or pollen which are causal inputs serving nutritional function
as representation and complexity the cognitive scientist and applied mathematician ronaldo vigo argues that information is concept that requires at least two related entities to make quantitative sense
these are any dimensionally defined category of objects and any of its subsets in essence is representation of or in other words conveys representational and hence conceptual information about vigo then defines the amount of information that conveys about as the rate of change in the complexity of whenever the objects in are removed from under vigo information pattern invariance complexity representation and information five fundamental constructs of universal science are unified under novel mathematical framework
among other things the framework aims to overcome the limitations of shannon weaver information when attempting to characterize and measure subjective information
as substitute for task wasted time energy and material michael grieves has proposed that the focus on information should be what it does as opposed to defining what it is
grieves has proposed that information can be substituted for wasted physical resources time energy and material for goal oriented tasks
goal oriented tasks can be divided into two components the most cost efficient use of physical resources time energy and material and the additional use of physical resources used by the task this second category is by definition wasted physical resources
information does not substitute or replace the most cost efficient use of physical resources but can be used to replace the wasted physical resources
the condition that this occurs under is that the cost of information is less than the cost of the wasted physical resources
since information is non rival good this can be especially beneficial for repeatable tasks
in manufacturing the task category of the most cost efficient use of physical resources is called lean manufacturing
as an influence that leads to transformation information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns
in this sense there is no need for conscious mind to perceive much less appreciate the pattern
consider for example dna
the sequence of nucleotides is pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for conscious mind
one might argue though that for human to consciously define pattern for example nucleotide naturally involves conscious information processing
systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind and patterns circulating due to feedback in the system can be called information
in other words it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation though not created or presented for that purpose
for example gregory bateson defines information as difference that makes difference if however the premise of influence implies that information has been perceived by conscious mind and also interpreted by it the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge
complex definitions of both information and knowledge make such semantic and logical analysis difficult but the condition of transformation is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge especially in the business discipline of knowledge management
in this practice tools and processes are used to assist knowledge worker in performing research and making decisions including steps such as review information to effectively derive value and meaning reference metadata if available establish relevant context often from many possible contexts derive new knowledge from the information make decisions or recommendations from the resulting knowledgestewart argues that transformation of information into knowledge is critical lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise
the danish dictionary of information terms argues that information only provides an answer to posed question
whether the answer provides knowledge depends on the informed person
so generalized definition of the concept should be information an answer to specific question
when marshall mcluhan speaks of media and their effects on human cultures he refers to the structure of artifacts that in turn shape our behaviors and mindsets
also pheromones are often said to be information in this sense
technologically mediated information these sections are using measurements of data rather than information as information cannot be directly measured
as of it is estimated that the world technological capacity to store information grew from optimally compressed exabytes in which is the informational equivalent to less than one mb cd rom per person mb per person to optimally compressed exabytes in this is the informational equivalent of almost cd rom per person in the world combined technological capacity to receive information through one way broadcast networks was the informational equivalent of newspapers per person per day in the world combined effective capacity to exchange information through two way telecommunication networks was the informational equivalent of newspapers per person per day in as of an estimated of all new information is digital mostly stored on hard drives
as of the total amount of data created captured copied and consumed globally is forecast to increase rapidly reaching zettabytes in over the next five years up to global data creation is projected to grow to more than zettabytes
as records records are specialized forms of information
essentially records are information produced consciously or as by products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value
primarily their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value
sound records management ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required
the international standard on records management iso defines records as information created received and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business
the international committee on archives ica committee on electronic records defined record as recorded information produced or received in the initiation conduct or completion of an institutional or individual activity and that comprises content context and structure sufficient to provide evidence of the activity records may be maintained to retain corporate memory of the organization or to meet legal fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization
willis expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered six key requirements for good corporate governance transparency accountability due process compliance meeting statutory and common law requirements and security of personal and corporate information
semiotics michael buckland has classified information in terms of its uses information as process information as knowledge and information as thing beynon davies explains the multi faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal sign systems
signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter dependent levels layers or branches of semiotics pragmatics semantics syntax and empirics
these four layers serve to connect the social world on the one hand with the physical or technical world on the other
pragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication
pragmatics links the issue of signs with the context within which signs are used
the focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of living agents underlying communicative behaviour
in other words pragmatics link language to action
semantics is concerned with the meaning of message conveyed in communicative act
semantics considers the content of communication
semantics is the study of the meaning of signs the association between signs and behaviour
semantics can be considered as the study of the link between symbols and their referents or concepts particularly the way that signs relate to human behavior
syntax is concerned with the formalism used to represent message
syntax as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems
syntax is devoted to the study of the form rather than the content of signs and sign systems
nielsen discusses the relationship between semiotics and information in relation to dictionaries
he introduces the concept of lexicographic information costs and refers to the effort user of dictionary must make to first find and then understand data so that they can generate information
communication normally exists within the context of some social situation
the social situation sets the context for the intentions conveyed pragmatics and the form of communication
in communicative situation intentions are expressed through messages that comprise collections of inter related signs taken from language mutually understood by the agents involved in the communication
mutual understanding implies that agents involved understand the chosen language in terms of its agreed syntax syntactics and semantics
the sender codes the message in the language and sends the message as signals along some communication channel empirics
the chosen communication channel has inherent properties that determine outcomes such as the speed at which communication can take place and over what distance
the application of information study the information cycle addressed as whole or in its distinct components is of great concern to information technology information systems as well as information science
these fields deal with those processes and techniques pertaining to information capture through sensors and generation through computation formulation or composition processing including encoding encryption compression packaging transmission including all telecommunication methods presentation including visualization display methods storage such as magnetic or optical including holographic methods etc
information visualization shortened as infovis depends on the computation and digital representation of data and assists users in pattern recognition and anomaly detection
information security shortened as infosec is the ongoing process of exercising due diligence to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure destruction modification disruption or distribution through algorithms and procedures focused on monitoring and detection as well as incident response and repair
information analysis is the process of inspecting transforming and modelling information by converting raw data into actionable knowledge in support of the decision making process
information quality shortened as infoq is the potential of dataset to achieve specific scientific or practical goal using given empirical analysis method
information communication represents the convergence of informatics telecommunication and audio visual media content

conceptual model is representation of system
it consists of concepts used to help people know understand or simulate subject the model represents
in contrast physical models are physical object such as toy model that may be assembled and made to work like the object it represents
the term may refer to models that are formed after conceptualization or generalization process
conceptual models are often abstractions of things in the real world whether physical or social
semantic studies are relevant to various stages of concept formation
semantics is basically about concepts the meaning that thinking beings give to various elements of their experience
overview models of concepts and models that are conceptual the term conceptual model is normal
it could mean model of concept or it could mean model that is conceptual
distinction can be made between what models are and what models are made of
with the exception of iconic models such as scale model of winchester cathedral most models are concepts
but they are mostly intended to be models of real world states of affairs
the value of model is usually directly proportional to how well it corresponds to past present future actual or potential state of affairs
model of concept is quite different because in order to be good model it need not have this real world correspondence
in artificial intelligence conceptual models and conceptual graphs are used for building expert systems and knowledge based systems here the analysts are concerned to represent expert opinion on what is true not their own ideas on what is true
type and scope of conceptual models conceptual models models that are conceptual range in type from the more concrete such as the mental image of familiar physical object to the formal generality and abstractness of mathematical models which do not appear to the mind as an image
conceptual models also range in terms of the scope of the subject matter that they are taken to represent
model may for instance represent single thing
the statue of liberty whole classes of things
the electron and even very vast domains of subject matter such as the physical universe
the variety and scope of conceptual models is due to the variety of purposes had by the people using them
conceptual modeling is the activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around us for the purposes of understanding and communication
fundamental objectives conceptual model primary objective is to convey the fundamental principles and basic functionality of the system which it represents
also conceptual model must be developed in such way as to provide an easily understood system interpretation for the model users
conceptual model when implemented properly should satisfy four fundamental objectives
enhance an individual understanding of the representative system facilitate efficient conveyance of system details between stakeholders provide point of reference for system designers to extract system specifications document the system for future reference and provide means for collaborationthe conceptual model plays an important role in the overall system development life cycle
figure below depicts the role of the conceptual model in typical system development scheme
it is clear that if the conceptual model is not fully developed the execution of fundamental system properties may not be implemented properly giving way to future problems or system shortfalls
these failures do occur in the industry and have been linked to lack of user input incomplete or unclear requirements and changing requirements
those weak links in the system design and development process can be traced to improper execution of the fundamental objectives of conceptual modeling
the importance of conceptual modeling is evident when such systemic failures are mitigated by thorough system development and adherence to proven development objectives techniques
modelling techniques as systems have become increasingly complex the role of conceptual modelling has dramatically expanded
with that expanded presence the effectiveness of conceptual modeling at capturing the fundamentals of system is being realized
building on that realization numerous conceptual modeling techniques have been created
these techniques can be applied across multiple disciplines to increase the user understanding of the system to be modeled
few techniques are briefly described in the following text however many more exist or are being developed
some commonly used conceptual modeling techniques and methods include workflow modeling workforce modeling rapid application development object role modeling and the unified modeling language uml
data flow modeling data flow modeling dfm is basic conceptual modeling technique that graphically represents elements of system
dfm is fairly simple technique however like many conceptual modeling techniques it is possible to construct higher and lower level representative diagrams
the data flow diagram usually does not convey complex system details such as parallel development considerations or timing information but rather works to bring the major system functions into context
data flow modeling is central technique used in systems development that utilizes the structured systems analysis and design method ssadm
entity relationship modeling entity relationship modeling erm is conceptual modeling technique used primarily for software system representation
entity relationship diagrams which are product of executing the erm technique are normally used to represent database models and information systems
the main components of the diagram are the entities and relationships
the entities can represent independent functions objects or events
the relationships are responsible for relating the entities to one another
to form system process the relationships are combined with the entities and any attributes needed to further describe the process
multiple diagramming conventions exist for this technique idef bachman and express to name few
these conventions are just different ways of viewing and organizing the data to represent different system aspects
event driven process chain the event driven process chain epc is conceptual modeling technique which is mainly used to systematically improve business process flows
like most conceptual modeling techniques the event driven process chain consists of entities elements and functions that allow relationships to be developed and processed
more specifically the epc is made up of events which define what state process is in or the rules by which it operates
in order to progress through events function active event must be executed
depending on the process flow the function has the ability to transform event states or link to other event driven process chains
other elements exist within an epc all of which work together to define how and by what rules the system operates
the epc technique can be applied to business practices such as resource planning process improvement and logistics
joint application development the dynamic systems development method uses specific process called jefff to conceptually model systems life cycle
jefff is intended to focus more on the higher level development planning that precedes project initialization
the jad process calls for series of workshops in which the participants work to identify define and generally map successful project from conception to completion
this method has been found to not work well for large scale applications however smaller applications usually report some net gain in efficiency
place transition net also known as petri nets this conceptual modeling technique allows system to be constructed with elements that can be described by direct mathematical means
the petri net because of its nondeterministic execution properties and well defined mathematical theory is useful technique for modeling concurrent system behavior
state transition modeling state transition modeling makes use of state transition diagrams to describe system behavior
these state transition diagrams use distinct states to define system behavior and changes
most current modeling tools contain some kind of ability to represent state transition modeling
the use of state transition models can be most easily recognized as logic state diagrams and directed graphs for finite state machines
technique evaluation and selection because the conceptual modeling method can sometimes be purposefully vague to account for broad area of use the actual application of concept modeling can become difficult
to alleviate this issue and shed some light on what to consider when selecting an appropriate conceptual modeling technique the framework proposed by gemino and wand will be discussed in the following text
however before evaluating the effectiveness of conceptual modeling technique for particular application an important concept must be understood comparing conceptual models by way of specifically focusing on their graphical or top level representations is shortsighted
gemino and wand make good point when arguing that the emphasis should be placed on conceptual modeling language when choosing an appropriate technique
in general conceptual model is developed using some form of conceptual modeling technique
that technique will utilize conceptual modeling language that determines the rules for how the model is arrived at
understanding the capabilities of the specific language used is inherent to properly evaluating conceptual modeling technique as the language reflects the techniques descriptive ability
also the conceptual modeling language will directly influence the depth at which the system is capable of being represented whether it be complex or simple
considering affecting factors building on some of their earlier work gemino and wand acknowledge some main points to consider when studying the affecting factors the content that the conceptual model must represent the method in which the model will be presented the characteristics of the model users and the conceptual model languages specific task
the conceptual model content should be considered in order to select technique that would allow relevant information to be presented
the presentation method for selection purposes would focus on the technique ability to represent the model at the intended level of depth and detail
the characteristics of the model users or participants is an important aspect to consider
participant background and experience should coincide with the conceptual model complexity else misrepresentation of the system or misunderstanding of key system concepts could lead to problems in that system realization
the conceptual model language task will further allow an appropriate technique to be chosen
the difference between creating system conceptual model to convey system functionality and creating system conceptual model to interpret that functionality could involve two completely different types of conceptual modeling languages
considering affected variables gemino and wand go on to expand the affected variable content of their proposed framework by considering the focus of observation and the criterion for comparison
the focus of observation considers whether the conceptual modeling technique will create new product or whether the technique will only bring about more intimate understanding of the system being modeled
the criterion for comparison would weigh the ability of the conceptual modeling technique to be efficient or effective
conceptual modeling technique that allows for development of system model which takes all system variables into account at high level may make the process of understanding the system functionality more efficient but the technique lacks the necessary information to explain the internal processes rendering the model less effective
when deciding which conceptual technique to use the recommendations of gemino and wand can be applied in order to properly evaluate the scope of the conceptual model in question
understanding the conceptual models scope will lead to more informed selection of technique that properly addresses that particular model
in summary when deciding between modeling techniques answering the following questions would allow one to address some important conceptual modeling considerations
what content will the conceptual model represent
how will the conceptual model be presented
who will be using or participating in the conceptual model
how will the conceptual model describe the system
what is the conceptual models focus of observation
will the conceptual model be efficient or effective in describing the system another function of the simulation conceptual model is to provide rational and factual basis for assessment of simulation application appropriateness
general model theory model is simplifying image of reality
the image can be either sensorily above all optically observable artefact or given purely theoretically
according to herbert stachowiak model is characterized by at least three properties mapping model always is model of something it is an image or representation of some natural or artificial existing or imagined original where this original itself could be model
reduction in general model will not include all attributes that describe the original but only those that appear as relevant to the model creator or user
pragmatism model does not relate unambiguously to its original
it is intended to work as replacement for the original for certain subjects for whom
within certain time range when
restricted to certain conceptual or physical actions what for
for example street map is model of the actual streets in city mapping showing the course of the streets while leaving out say traffic signs and road markings reduction made for pedestrians and vehicle drivers for the purpose of finding one way in the city pragmatism
additional properties have been proposed like extension and distortion as well as validity
the american philosopher michael weisberg differentiates between concrete and mathematical models and proposes computer simulations computational models as their own class of models
models in philosophy and science mental model in cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind mental model is representation of something in the mind but mental model may also refer to nonphysical external model of the mind itself
metaphysical models metaphysical model is type of conceptual model which is distinguished from other conceptual models by its proposed scope metaphysical model intends to represent reality in the broadest possible way
this is to say that it explains the answers to fundamental questions such as whether matter and mind are one or two substances or whether or not humans have free will
conceptual model vs semantics model conceptual models and semantic models have many similarities however the way they are presented the level of flexibility and the use are different
conceptual models have certain purpose in mind hence the core semantic concepts are predefined in so called meta model
this enables pragmatic modelling but reduces the flexibility as only the predefined semantic concepts can be used
samples are flow charts for process behaviour or organisational structure for tree behaviour
semantic models are more flexible and open and therefore more difficult to model
potentially any semantic concept can be defined hence the modelling support is very generic
samples are terminologies taxonomies or ontologies
in concept model each concept has unique and distinguishable graphical representation whereas semantic concepts are by default the same
in concept model each concept has predefined properties that can be populated whereas semantic concepts are related to concepts that are interpreted as properties
in concept model operational semantic can be built in like the processing of sequence whereas semantic model needs explicit semantic definition of the sequence
the decision if concept model or semantic model is used depends therefore on the object under survey the intended goal the necessary flexibility as well as how the model is interpreted
in case of human interpretation there may be focus on graphical concept models in case of machine interpretation there may be the focus on semantic models
epistemological models an epistemological model is type of conceptual model whose proposed scope is the known and the knowable and the believed and the believable
logical models in logic model is type of interpretation under which particular statement is true
logical models can be broadly divided into ones which only attempt to represent concepts such as mathematical models and ones which attempt to represent physical objects and factual relationships among which are scientific models
model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures such as groups fields graphs or even universes of set theory using tools from mathematical logic
system that gives meaning to the sentences of formal language is called model for the language
if model for language moreover satisfies particular sentence or theory set of sentences it is called model of the sentence or theory
model theory has close ties to algebra and universal algebra
mathematical models mathematical models can take many forms including but not limited to dynamical systems statistical models differential equations or game theoretic models
these and other types of models can overlap with given model involving variety of abstract structures
more comprehensive type of mathematical model uses linguistic version of category theory to model given situation
akin to entity relationship models custom categories or sketches can be directly translated into database schemas
the difference is that logic is replaced by category theory which brings powerful theorems to bear on the subject of modeling especially useful for translating between disparate models as functors between categories
scientific models scientific model is simplified abstract view of complex reality
scientific model represents empirical objects phenomena and physical processes in logical way
attempts to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences use an interpretation to model reality in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic
the aim of these attempts is to construct formal system that will not produce theoretical consequences that are contrary to what is found in reality
predictions or other statements drawn from such formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true
statistical models statistical model is probability distribution function proposed as generating data
in parametric model the probability distribution function has variable parameters such as the mean and variance in normal distribution or the coefficients for the various exponents of the independent variable in linear regression
nonparametric model has distribution function without parameters such as in bootstrapping and is only loosely confined by assumptions
model selection is statistical method for selecting distribution function within class of them in linear regression where the dependent variable is polynomial of the independent variable with parametric coefficients model selection is selecting the highest exponent and may be done with nonparametric means such as with cross validation
in statistics there can be models of mental events as well as models of physical events
for example statistical model of customer behavior is model that is conceptual because behavior is physical but statistical model of customer satisfaction is model of concept because satisfaction is mental not physical event
social and political models economic models in economics model is theoretical construct that represents economic processes by set of variables and set of logical and or quantitative relationships between them
the economic model is simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes often but not always using mathematical techniques
frequently economic models use structural parameters
structural parameters are underlying parameters in model or class of models
model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties
models in systems architecture system model is the conceptual model that describes and represents the structure behavior and more views of system
system model can represent multiple views of system by using two different approaches
the first one is the non architectural approach and the second one is the architectural approach
the non architectural approach respectively picks model for each view
the architectural approach also known as system architecture instead of picking many heterogeneous and unrelated models will use only one integrated architectural model
business process modelling in business process modelling the enterprise process model is often referred to as the business process model
process models are core concepts in the discipline of process engineering
process models are processes of the same nature that are classified together into model
description of process at the type level
since the process model is at the type level process is an instantiation of it the same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus has many instantiations
one possible use of process model is to prescribe how things must should could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens
process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like
what the process shall be will be determined during actual system development
models in information system design conceptual models of human activity systems conceptual models of human activity systems are used in soft systems methodology ssm which is method of systems analysis concerned with the structuring of problems in management
these models are models of concepts the authors specifically state that they are not intended to represent state of affairs in the physical world
they are also used in information requirements analysis ira which is variant of ssm developed for information system design and software engineering
logico linguistic models logico linguistic modeling is another variant of ssm that uses conceptual models
however this method combines models of concepts with models of putative real world objects and events
it is graphical representation of modal logic in which modal operators are used to distinguish statement about concepts from statements about real world objects and events
data models entity relationship model in software engineering an entity relationship model erm is an abstract and conceptual representation of data
entity relationship modeling is database modeling method used to produce type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of system often relational database and its requirements in top down fashion
diagrams created by this process are called entity relationship diagrams er diagrams or erds
entity relationship models have had wide application in the building of information systems intended to support activities involving objects and events in the real world
in these cases they are models that are conceptual
however this modeling method can be used to build computer games or family tree of the greek gods in these cases it would be used to model concepts
domain model domain model is type of conceptual model used to depict the structural elements and their conceptual constraints within domain of interest sometimes called the problem domain
domain model includes the various entities their attributes and relationships plus the constraints governing the conceptual integrity of the structural model elements comprising that problem domain
domain model may also include number of conceptual views where each view is pertinent to particular subject area of the domain or to particular subset of the domain model which is of interest to stakeholder of the domain model
like entity relationship models domain models can be used to model concepts or to model real world objects and events

cornelius cornel lanczos hungarian nczos korn pronounced la nt so korne born as korn wy until wy wy korn february june was hungarian american and later hungarian irish mathematician and physicist
according to gy rgy marx he was one of the martians
biography he was born in feh rv alba regia fej county kingdom of hungary to roly wy and ad hahn
lanczos ph thesis was on relativity theory
he sent his thesis copy to albert einstein and einstein wrote back saying studied your paper as far as my present overload allowed
believe may say this much this does involve competent and original brainwork on the basis of which doctorate should be obtainable gladly accept the honorable dedication
in he discovered an exact solution of the einstein field equation representing cylindrically symmetric rigidly rotating configuration of dust particles
this was later rediscovered by willem jacob van stockum and is known today as the van stockum dust
it is one of the simplest known exact solutions in general relativity and is regarded as an important example in part because it exhibits closed timelike curves
lanczos served as assistant to albert einstein during the period of
in lanczos married maria rupp
he was offered one year visiting professorship from purdue university
for dozen years lanczos split his life between two continents
his wife maria rupp stayed with lanczos parents in sz kesfeh rv year around while lanczos went to purdue for half the year teaching graduate students matrix mechanics and tensor analysis
in his son elmar was born elmar came to lafayette indiana with his father in august just before ww ii broke out
maria was too ill to travel and died several weeks later from tuberculosis
when the nazis purged hungary of jews in of lanczos family only his sister and nephew survived
elmar married moved to seattle and raised two sons
when elmar looked at his own firstborn son he said for me it proves that hitler did not win
during the mccarthy era lanczos came under suspicion for possible communist links
in he left the and moved to the school of theoretical physics at the dublin institute for advanced studies in ireland where he succeeded erwin schr dinger and stayed until his death in in lanczos published applied analysis
the topics covered include algebraic equations matrices and eigenvalue problems large scale linear systems harmonic analysis data analysis quadrature and power expansions illustrated by numerical examples worked out in detail
the contents of the book are stylized parexic analysis lies between classical analysis and numerical analysis it is roughly the theory of approximation by finite or truncated infinite algorithms
research lanczos did pioneering work along with danielson on what is now called the fast fourier transform fft but the significance of his discovery was not appreciated at the time and today the fft is credited to cooley and tukey
as matter of fact similar claims can be made for several other mathematicians including carl friedrich gauss
lanczos was the one who introduced chebyshev polynomials to numerical computing
he discovered the diagonalizable matrix
working in washington dc at the national bureau of standards after lanczos developed number of techniques for mathematical calculations using digital computers including the lanczos algorithm for finding eigenvalues of large symmetric matrices the lanczos approximation for the gamma function the conjugate gradient method for solving systems of linear equations in lanczos showed that the weyl tensor which plays fundamental role in general relativity can be obtained from tensor potential that is now called the lanczos potential

in probability theory and statistics covariance matrix also known as auto covariance matrix dispersion matrix variance matrix or variance covariance matrix is square matrix giving the covariance between each pair of elements of given random vector
any covariance matrix is symmetric and positive semi definite and its main diagonal contains variances the covariance of each element with itself
intuitively the covariance matrix generalizes the notion of variance to multiple dimensions
as an example the variation in collection of random points in two dimensional space cannot be characterized fully by single number nor would the variances in the and directions contain all of the necessary information matrix would be necessary to fully characterize the two dimensional variation
the covariance matrix of random vector is typically denoted by or
definition throughout this article boldfaced unsubscripted and are used to refer to random vectors and unboldfaced subscripted and are used to refer to scalar random variables
if the entries in the column vector
are random variables each with finite variance and expected value then the covariance matrix is the matrix whose entry is the covariance cov where the operator denotes the expected value mean of its argument
conflicting nomenclatures and notations nomenclatures differ
some statisticians following the probabilist william feller in his two volume book an introduction to probability theory and its applications call the matrix the variance of the random vector because it is the natural generalization to higher dimensions of the dimensional variance
others call it the covariance matrix because it is the matrix of covariances between the scalar components of the vector var cov
both forms are quite standard and there is no ambiguity between them
the matrix is also often called the variance covariance matrix since the diagonal terms are in fact variances
by comparison the notation for the cross covariance matrix between two vectors is cov
properties relation to the autocorrelation matrix the auto covariance matrix is related to the autocorrelation matrix by where the autocorrelation matrix is defined as
relation to the correlation matrix an entity closely related to the covariance matrix is the matrix of pearson product moment correlation coefficients between each of the random variables in the random vector which can be written as corr diag diag where diag is the matrix of the diagonal elements of diagonal matrix of the variances of for
equivalently the correlation matrix can be seen as the covariance matrix of the standardized random variables for corr
each element on the principal diagonal of correlation matrix is the correlation of random variable with itself which always equals each off diagonal element is between and inclusive
inverse of the covariance matrix the inverse of this matrix if it exists is the inverse covariance matrix or inverse concentration matrix also known as the precision matrix or concentration matrix just as the covariance matrix can be written as the rescaling of correlation matrix by the marginal variances cov so using the idea of partial correlation and partial variance the inverse covariance matrix can be expressed analogously cov this duality motivates number of other dualities between marginalizing and conditioning for gaussian random variables
basic properties for var and where is dimensional random variable the following basic properties apply is positive semidefinite
for all is symmetric
non random matrix and constant vector one has var var if is another random vector with the same dimension as then var var cov cov var where cov is the cross covariance matrix of and
block matrices the joint mean and joint covariance matrix of and can be written in block form where var var and cov
and can be identified as the variance matrices of the marginal distributions for and respectively
if and are jointly normally distributed then the conditional distribution for given is given by defined by conditional mean and conditional variance the matrix is known as the matrix of regression coefficients while in linear algebra is the schur complement of in the matrix of regression coefficients may often be given in transpose form suitable for post multiplying row vector of explanatory variables rather than pre multiplying column vector in this form they correspond to the coefficients obtained by inverting the matrix of the normal equations of ordinary least squares ols
partial covariance matrix covariance matrix with all non zero elements tells us that all the individual random variables are interrelated
this means that the variables are not only directly correlated but also correlated via other variables indirectly
often such indirect common mode correlations are trivial and uninteresting
they can be suppressed by calculating the partial covariance matrix that is the part of covariance matrix that shows only the interesting part of correlations
if two vectors of random variables and are correlated via another vector the latter correlations are suppressed in matrix pcov cov cov cov cov
the partial covariance matrix is effectively the simple covariance matrix as if the uninteresting random variables were held constant
covariance matrix as parameter of distribution if column vector of possibly correlated random variables is jointly normally distributed or more generally elliptically distributed then its probability density function can be expressed in terms of the covariance matrix as follows exp where and is the determinant of
covariance matrix as linear operator applied to one vector the covariance matrix maps linear combination of the random variables onto vector of covariances with those variables cov
treated as bilinear form it yields the covariance between the two linear combinations cov
the variance of linear combination is then its covariance with itself
similarly the pseudo inverse covariance matrix provides an inner product which induces the mahalanobis distance measure of the unlikelihood of which matrices are covariance matrices
from the identity just above let be real valued vector then var var which must always be nonnegative since it is the variance of real valued random variable so covariance matrix is always positive semidefinite matrix
the above argument can be expanded as follows where the last inequality follows from the observation that is scalar
conversely every symmetric positive semi definite matrix is covariance matrix
to see this suppose is symmetric positive semidefinite matrix
from the finite dimensional case of the spectral theorem it follows that has nonnegative symmetric square root which can be denoted by
let be any column vector valued random variable whose covariance matrix is the identity matrix
then var var complex random vectors the variance of complex scalar valued random variable with expected value is conventionally defined using complex conjugation var where the complex conjugate of complex number is denoted thus the variance of complex random variable is real number
if is column vector of complex valued random variables then the conjugate transpose is formed by both transposing and conjugating
in the following expression the product of vector with its conjugate transpose results in square matrix called the covariance matrix as its expectation cov the matrix so obtained will be hermitian positive semidefinite with real numbers in the main diagonal and complex numbers off diagonal
propertiesthe covariance matrix is hermitian matrix
the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are real
pseudo covariance matrix for complex random vectors another kind of second central moment the pseudo covariance matrix also called relation matrix is defined as follows cov in contrast to the covariance matrix defined above hermitian transposition gets replaced by transposition in the definition
its diagonal elements may be complex valued it is complex symmetric matrix
estimation if and are centred data matrices of dimension and respectively
with columns of observations of and rows of variables from which the row means have been subtracted then if the row means were estimated from the data sample covariance matrices and can be defined to be or if the row means were known priori these empirical sample covariance matrices are the most straightforward and most often used estimators for the covariance matrices but other estimators also exist including regularised or shrinkage estimators which may have better properties
applications the covariance matrix is useful tool in many different areas
from it transformation matrix can be derived called whitening transformation that allows one to completely decorrelate the data or from different point of view to find an optimal basis for representing the data in compact way see rayleigh quotient for formal proof and additional properties of covariance matrices
this is called principal component analysis pca and the karhunen lo ve transform kl transform
the covariance matrix plays key role in financial economics especially in portfolio theory and its mutual fund separation theorem and in the capital asset pricing model
the matrix of covariances among various assets returns is used to determine under certain assumptions the relative amounts of different assets that investors should in normative analysis or are predicted to in positive analysis choose to hold in context of diversification
use in optimization the evolution strategy particular family of randomized search heuristics fundamentally relies on covariance matrix in its mechanism
the characteristic mutation operator draws the update step from multivariate normal distribution using an evolving covariance matrix
there is formal proof that the evolution strategy covariance matrix adapts to the inverse of the hessian matrix of the search landscape up to scalar factor and small random fluctuations proven for single parent strategy and static model as the population size increases relying on the quadratic approximation
intuitively this result is supported by the rationale that the optimal covariance distribution can offer mutation steps whose equidensity probability contours match the level sets of the landscape and so they maximize the progress rate
covariance mapping in covariance mapping the values of the cov or pcov matrix are plotted as dimensional map
when vectors and are discrete random functions the map shows statistical relations between different regions of the random functions
statistically independent regions of the functions show up on the map as zero level flatland while positive or negative correlations show up respectively as hills or valleys
in practice the column vectors and are acquired experimentally as rows of samples
where is the th discrete value in sample of the random function
the expected values needed in the covariance formula are estimated using the sample mean
and the covariance matrix is estimated by the sample covariance matrix cov where the angular brackets denote sample averaging as before except that the bessel correction should be made to avoid bias
using this estimation the partial covariance matrix can be calculated as pcov cov cov cov cov where the backslash denotes the left matrix division operator which bypasses the requirement to invert matrix and is available in some computational packages such as matlab
illustrates how partial covariance map is constructed on an example of an experiment performed at the flash free electron laser in hamburg
the random function is the time of flight spectrum of ions from coulomb explosion of nitrogen molecules multiply ionised by laser pulse
since only few hundreds of molecules are ionised at each laser pulse the single shot spectra are highly fluctuating
however collecting typically such spectra and averaging them over produces smooth spectrum which is shown in red at the bottom of fig
the average spectrum reveals several nitrogen ions in form of peaks broadened by their kinetic energy but to find the correlations between the ionisation stages and the ion momenta requires calculating covariance map
in the example of fig
spectra and are the same except that the range of the time of flight differs
panel shows panel shows and panel shows their difference which is cov note change in the colour scale
unfortunately this map is overwhelmed by uninteresting common mode correlations induced by laser intensity fluctuating from shot to shot
to suppress such correlations the laser intensity is recorded at every shot put into and pcov is calculated as panels and show
the suppression of the uninteresting correlations is however imperfect because there are other sources of common mode fluctuations than the laser intensity and in principle all these sources should be monitored in vector yet in practice it is often sufficient to overcompensate the partial covariance correction as panel shows where interesting correlations of ion momenta are now clearly visible as straight lines centred on ionisation stages of atomic nitrogen
two dimensional infrared spectroscopy two dimensional infrared spectroscopy employs correlation analysis to obtain spectra of the condensed phase
there are two versions of this analysis synchronous and asynchronous
mathematically the former is expressed in terms of the sample covariance matrix and the technique is equivalent to covariance mapping

in information theory low density parity check ldpc code is linear error correcting code method of transmitting message over noisy transmission channel
an ldpc code is constructed using sparse tanner graph subclass of the bipartite graph
ldpc codes are capacity approaching codes which means that practical constructions exist that allow the noise threshold to be set very close to the theoretical maximum the shannon limit for symmetric memoryless channel
the noise threshold defines an upper bound for the channel noise up to which the probability of lost information can be made as small as desired
using iterative belief propagation techniques ldpc codes can be decoded in time linear to their block length
ldpc codes are finding increasing use in applications requiring reliable and highly efficient information transfer over bandwidth constrained or return channel constrained links in the presence of corrupting noise
implementation of ldpc codes has lagged behind that of other codes notably turbo codes
the fundamental patent for turbo codes expired on august ldpc codes are also known as gallager codes in honor of robert gallager who developed the ldpc concept in his doctoral dissertation at the massachusetts institute of technology in ldpc codes have also been shown to have ideal combinatorial properties
in his dissertation gallager showed that ldpc codes achieve the gilbert varshamov bound for linear codes over binary fields with high probability
in it was shown that gallager ldpc codes achieve list decoding capacity and also achieve the gilbert varshamov bound for linear codes over general fields
history impractical to implement when first developed by gallager in ldpc codes were forgotten until his work was rediscovered in turbo codes another class of capacity approaching codes discovered in became the coding scheme of choice in the late used for applications such as the deep space network and satellite communications
however the advances in low density parity check codes have seen them surpass turbo codes in terms of error floor and performance in the higher code rate range leaving turbo codes better suited for the lower code rates only
applications in an irregular repeat accumulate ira style ldpc code beat six turbo codes to become the error correcting code in the new dvb standard for digital television
the dvb selection committee made decoder complexity estimates for the turbo code proposals using much less efficient serial decoder architecture rather than parallel decoder architecture
this forced the turbo code proposals to use frame sizes on the order of one half the frame size of the ldpc proposals
in ldpc beat convolutional turbo codes as the forward error correction fec system for the itu hn standard
hn chose ldpc codes over turbo codes because of their lower decoding complexity especially when operating at data rates close to gbit and because the proposed turbo codes exhibited significant error floor at the desired range of operation ldpc codes are also used for gbase ethernet which sends data at gigabits per second over twisted pair cables
as of ldpc codes are also part of the wi fi standard as an optional part of and ac in the high throughput ht phy specification
ldpc is mandatory part of ax wi fi some ofdm systems add an additional outer error correction that fixes the occasional errors the error floor that get past the ldpc correction inner code even at low bit error rates
for example the reed solomon code with ldpc coded modulation rs lcm uses reed solomon outer code
the dvb the dvb and the dvb standards all use bch code outer code to mop up residual errors after ldpc decoding nr uses polar code for the control channels and ldpc for the data channels although ldpc code has had its success in commercial hard disk drives to fully exploit its error correction capability in ssds demands unconventional fine grained flash memory sensing leading to an increased memory read latency
ldpc in ssd is an effective approach to deploy ldpc in ssd with very small latency increase which turns ldpc in ssd into reality
since then ldpc has been widely adopted in commercial ssds in both customer grades and enterprise grades by major storage venders
many tlc and later ssds are using ldpc codes
fast hard decode binary erasure is first attempted which can fall back into the slower but more powerful soft decoding
operational use ldpc codes functionally are defined by sparse parity check matrix
this sparse matrix is often randomly generated subject to the sparsity constraints ldpc code construction is discussed later
these codes were first designed by robert gallager in below is graph fragment of an example ldpc code using forney factor graph notation
in this graph variable nodes in the top of the graph are connected to constraint nodes in the bottom of the graph
this is popular way of graphically representing an ldpc code
the bits of valid message when placed on the at the top of the graph satisfy the graphical constraints
specifically all lines connecting to variable node box with an sign have the same value and all values connecting to factor node box with sign must sum modulo two to zero in other words they must sum to an even number or there must be an even number of odd values
ignoring any lines going out of the picture there are eight possible six bit strings corresponding to valid codewords
this ldpc code fragment represents three bit message encoded as six bits
redundancy is used here to increase the chance of recovering from channel errors
this is linear code with and again ignoring lines going out of the picture the parity check matrix representing this graph fragment is
in this matrix each row represents one of the three parity check constraints while each column represents one of the six bits in the received codeword
in this example the eight codewords can be obtained by putting the parity check matrix into this form through basic row operations in gf step step row is added to row step row and are swapped
step row is added to row from this the generator matrix can be obtained as noting that in the special case of this being binary code or specifically
finally by multiplying all eight possible bit strings by all eight valid codewords are obtained
for example the codeword for the bit string is obtained by where is symbol of mod multiplication
as check the row space of is orthogonal to such that the bit string is found in as the first bits of the codeword
example encoder figure illustrates the functional components of most ldpc encoders
during the encoding of frame the input data bits are repeated and distributed to set of constituent encoders
the constituent encoders are typically accumulators and each accumulator is used to generate parity symbol
single copy of the original data is transmitted with the parity bits to make up the code symbols
the bits from each constituent encoder are discarded
the parity bit may be used within another constituent code
in an example using the dvb rate code the encoded block size is symbols with data bits and parity bits
each constituent code check node encodes data bits except for the first parity bit which encodes data bits
the first data bits are repeated times used in parity codes while the remaining data bits are used in parity codes irregular ldpc code
for comparison classic turbo codes typically use two constituent codes configured in parallel each of which encodes the entire input block of data bits
these constituent encoders are recursive convolutional codes rsc of moderate depth or states that are separated by code interleaver which interleaves one copy of the frame
the ldpc code in contrast uses many low depth constituent codes accumulators in parallel each of which encode only small portion of the input frame
the many constituent codes can be viewed as many low depth state convolutional codes that are connected via the repeat and distribute operations
the repeat and distribute operations perform the function of the interleaver in the turbo code
the ability to more precisely manage the connections of the various constituent codes and the level of redundancy for each input bit give more flexibility in the design of ldpc codes which can lead to better performance than turbo codes in some instances
turbo codes still seem to perform better than ldpcs at low code rates or at least the design of well performing low rate codes is easier for turbo codes
as practical matter the hardware that forms the accumulators is reused during the encoding process
that is once first set of parity bits are generated and the parity bits stored the same accumulator hardware is used to generate next set of parity bits
decoding as with other codes the maximum likelihood decoding of an ldpc code on the binary symmetric channel is an np complete problem
performing optimal decoding for np complete code of any useful size is not practical
however sub optimal techniques based on iterative belief propagation decoding give excellent results and can be practically implemented
the sub optimal decoding techniques view each parity check that makes up the ldpc as an independent single parity check spc code
each spc code is decoded separately using soft in soft out siso techniques such as sova bcjr map and other derivates thereof
the soft decision information from each siso decoding is cross checked and updated with other redundant spc decodings of the same information bit
each spc code is then decoded again using the updated soft decision information
this process is iterated until valid codeword is achieved or decoding is exhausted
this type of decoding is often referred to as sum product decoding
the decoding of the spc codes is often referred to as the check node processing and the cross checking of the variables is often referred to as the variable node processing
in practical ldpc decoder implementation sets of spc codes are decoded in parallel to increase throughput
in contrast belief propagation on the binary erasure channel is particularly simple where it consists of iterative constraint satisfaction
for example consider that the valid codeword from the example above is transmitted across binary erasure channel and received with the first and fourth bit erased to yield
since the transmitted message must have satisfied the code constraints the message can be represented by writing the received message on the top of the factor graph
in this example the first bit cannot yet be recovered because all of the constraints connected to it have more than one unknown bit
in order to proceed with decoding the message constraints connecting to only one of the erased bits must be identified
in this example only the second constraint suffices
examining the second constraint the fourth bit must have been zero since only zero in that position would satisfy the constraint
this procedure is then iterated
the new value for the fourth bit can now be used in conjunction with the first constraint to recover the first bit as seen below
this means that the first bit must be one to satisfy the leftmost constraint
thus the message can be decoded iteratively
for other channel models the messages passed between the variable nodes and check nodes are real numbers which express probabilities and likelihoods of belief
this result can be validated by multiplying the corrected codeword by the parity check matrix
because the outcome the syndrome of this operation is the three one zero vector the resulting codeword is successfully validated
after the decoding is completed the original message bits can be extracted by looking at the first bits of the codeword
while illustrative this erasure example does not show the use of soft decision decoding or soft decision message passing which is used in virtually all commercial ldpc decoders
updating node information in recent years there has also been great deal of work spent studying the effects of alternative schedules for variable node and constraint node update
the original technique that was used for decoding ldpc codes was known as flooding
this type of update required that before updating variable node all constraint nodes needed to be updated and vice versa
in later work by vila casado et al alternative update techniques were studied in which variable nodes are updated with the newest available check node information
the intuition behind these algorithms is that variable nodes whose values vary the most are the ones that need to be updated first
highly reliable nodes whose log likelihood ratio llr magnitude is large and does not change significantly from one update to the next do not require updates with the same frequency as other nodes whose sign and magnitude fluctuate more widely
these scheduling algorithms show greater speed of convergence and lower error floors than those that use flooding
these lower error floors are achieved by the ability of the informed dynamic scheduling ids algorithm to overcome trapping sets of near codewords when nonflooding scheduling algorithms are used an alternative definition of iteration is used
for an ldpc code of rate full iteration occurs when variable and constraint nodes have been updated no matter the order in which they were updated
code construction for large block sizes ldpc codes are commonly constructed by first studying the behaviour of decoders
as the block size tends to infinity ldpc decoders can be shown to have noise threshold below which decoding is reliably achieved and above which decoding is not achieved colloquially referred to as the cliff effect
this threshold can be optimised by finding the best proportion of arcs from check nodes and arcs from variable nodes
an approximate graphical approach to visualising this threshold is an exit chart
the construction of specific ldpc code after this optimization falls into two main types of techniques pseudorandom approaches combinatorial approachesconstruction by pseudo random approach builds on theoretical results that for large block size random construction gives good decoding performance
in general pseudorandom codes have complex encoders but pseudorandom codes with the best decoders can have simple encoders
various constraints are often applied to help ensure that the desired properties expected at the theoretical limit of infinite block size occur at finite block size
combinatorial approaches can be used to optimize the properties of small block size ldpc codes or to create codes with simple encoders
some ldpc codes are based on reed solomon codes such as the rs ldpc code used in the gigabit ethernet standard
compared to randomly generated ldpc codes structured ldpc codes such as the ldpc code used in the dvb standard can have simpler and therefore lower cost hardware in particular codes constructed such that the matrix is circulant matrix yet another way of constructing ldpc codes is to use finite geometries
this method was proposed by kou et al
ldpc codes vs turbo codes ldpc codes can be compared with other powerful coding schemes
in one hand ber performance of turbo codes is influenced by low codes limitations
ldpc codes have no limitations of minimum distance that indirectly means that ldpc codes may be more efficient on relatively large code rates
however ldpc codes are not the complete replacement turbo codes are the best solution at the lower code rates

in the field of multivariate statistics kernel principal component analysis kernel pca is an extension of principal component analysis pca using techniques of kernel methods
using kernel the originally linear operations of pca are performed in reproducing kernel hilbert space
background linear pca recall that conventional pca operates on zero centered data that is where is one of the multivariate observations
it operates by diagonalizing the covariance matrix in other words it gives an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix which can be rewritten as for see also covariance matrix as linear operator introduction of the kernel to pca to understand the utility of kernel pca particularly for clustering observe that while points cannot in general be linearly separated in dimensions they can almost always be linearly separated in dimensions
that is given points if we map them to an dimensional space with where it is easy to construct hyperplane that divides the points into arbitrary clusters
of course this creates linearly independent vectors so there is no covariance on which to perform eigendecomposition explicitly as we would in linear pca
instead in kernel pca non trivial arbitrary function is chosen that is never calculated explicitly allowing the possibility to use very high dimensional if we never have to actually evaluate the data in that space
since we generally try to avoid working in the space which we will call the feature space we can create the by kernel which represents the inner product space see gramian matrix of the otherwise intractable feature space
the dual form that arises in the creation of kernel allows us to mathematically formulate version of pca in which we never actually solve the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix in the space see kernel trick
the elements in each column of represent the dot product of one point of the transformed data with respect to all the transformed points points
some well known kernels are shown in the example below
because we are never working directly in the feature space the kernel formulation of pca is restricted in that it computes not the principal components themselves but the projections of our data onto those components
to evaluate the projection from point in the feature space onto the kth principal component where superscript means the component not powers of we note that denotes dot product which is simply the elements of the kernel it seems all that left is to calculate and normalize the which can be done by solving the eigenvector equation where is the number of data points in the set and and are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of then to normalize the eigenvectors we require that care must be taken regarding the fact that whether or not has zero mean in its original space it is not guaranteed to be centered in the feature space which we never compute explicitly
since centered data is required to perform an effective principal component analysis we centralize to become where denotes by matrix for which each element takes value we use to perform the kernel pca algorithm described above
one caveat of kernel pca should be illustrated here
in linear pca we can use the eigenvalues to rank the eigenvectors based on how much of the variation of the data is captured by each principal component
this is useful for data dimensionality reduction and it could also be applied to kpca
however in practice there are cases that all variations of the data are same
this is typically caused by wrong choice of kernel scale
large datasets in practice large data set leads to large and storing may become problem
one way to deal with this is to perform clustering on the dataset and populate the kernel with the means of those clusters
since even this method may yield relatively large it is common to compute only the top eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the eigenvalues are calculated in this way
example consider three concentric clouds of points shown we wish to use kernel pca to identify these groups
the color of the points does not represent information involved in the algorithm but only shows how the transformation relocates the data points
first consider the kernel applying this to kernel pca yields the next image
now consider gaussian kernel that is this kernel is measure of closeness equal to when the points coincide and equal to at infinity
note in particular that the first principal component is enough to distinguish the three different groups which is impossible using only linear pca because linear pca operates only in the given in this case two dimensional space in which these concentric point clouds are not linearly separable
applications kernel pca has been demonstrated to be useful for novelty detection and image de noising

in statistics principal component regression pcr is regression analysis technique that is based on principal component analysis pca
more specifically pcr is used for estimating the unknown regression coefficients in standard linear regression model
in pcr instead of regressing the dependent variable on the explanatory variables directly the principal components of the explanatory variables are used as regressors
one typically uses only subset of all the principal components for regression making pcr kind of regularized procedure and also type of shrinkage estimator
often the principal components with higher variances the ones based on eigenvectors corresponding to the higher eigenvalues of the sample variance covariance matrix of the explanatory variables are selected as regressors
however for the purpose of predicting the outcome the principal components with low variances may also be important in some cases even more important one major use of pcr lies in overcoming the multicollinearity problem which arises when two or more of the explanatory variables are close to being collinear
pcr can aptly deal with such situations by excluding some of the low variance principal components in the regression step
in addition by usually regressing on only subset of all the principal components pcr can result in dimension reduction through substantially lowering the effective number of parameters characterizing the underlying model
this can be particularly useful in settings with high dimensional covariates
also through appropriate selection of the principal components to be used for regression pcr can lead to efficient prediction of the outcome based on the assumed model
the principle the pcr method may be broadly divided into three major steps perform pca on the observed data matrix for the explanatory variables to obtain the principal components and then usually select subset based on some appropriate criteria of the principal components so obtained for further use
now regress the observed vector of outcomes on the selected principal components as covariates using ordinary least squares regression linear regression to get vector of estimated regression coefficients with dimension equal to the number of selected principal components now transform this vector back to the scale of the actual covariates using the selected pca loadings the eigenvectors corresponding to the selected principal components to get the final pcr estimator with dimension equal to the total number of covariates for estimating the regression coefficients characterizing the original model
details of the method data representation let denote the vector of observed outcomes and denote the corresponding data matrix of observed covariates where and denote the size of the observed sample and the number of covariates respectively with each of the rows of denotes one set of observations for the dimensional covariate and the respective entry of denotes the corresponding observed outcome
data pre processing assume that and each of the columns of have already been centered so that all of them have zero empirical means
this centering step is crucial at least for the columns of since pcr involves the use of pca on and pca is sensitive to centering of the data
underlying model following centering the standard gauss markov linear regression model for on can be represented as where denotes the unknown parameter vector of regression coefficients and denotes the vector of random errors with and var for some unknown variance parameter objective the primary goal is to obtain an efficient estimator for the parameter based on the data
one frequently used approach for this is ordinary least squares regression which assuming is full column rank gives the unbiased estimator of pcr is another technique that may be used for the same purpose of estimating pca step pcr starts by performing pca on the centered data matrix for this let denote the singular value decomposition of where diag with denoting the non negative singular values of while the columns of and are both orthonormal sets of vectors denoting the left and right singular vectors of respectively
the principal components gives spectral decomposition of where diag diag with denoting the non negative eigenvalues also known as the principal values of while the columns of denote the corresponding orthonormal set of eigenvectors
then and respectively denote the principal component and the principal component direction or pca loading corresponding to the th largest principal value for each
derived covariates for any let denote the matrix with orthonormal columns consisting of the first columns of let denote the matrix having the first principal components as its columns
may be viewed as the data matrix obtained by using the transformed covariates instead of using the original covariates the pcr estimator let denote the vector of estimated regression coefficients obtained by ordinary least squares regression of the response vector on the data matrix then for any the final pcr estimator of based on using the first principal components is given by fundamental characteristics and applications of the pcr estimator two basic properties the fitting process for obtaining the pcr estimator involves regressing the response vector on the derived data matrix which has orthogonal columns for any since the principal components are mutually orthogonal to each other
thus in the regression step performing multiple linear regression jointly on the selected principal components as covariates is equivalent to carrying out independent simple linear regressions or univariate regressions separately on each of the selected principal components as covariate
when all the principal components are selected for regression so that then the pcr estimator is equivalent to the ordinary least squares estimator
thus this is easily seen from the fact that and also observing that is an orthogonal matrix
variance reduction for any the variance of is given by var diag in particular var var hence for all we have var var thus for all we have var var where indicates that square symmetric matrix is non negative definite
consequently any given linear form of the pcr estimator has lower variance compared to that of the same linear form of the ordinary least squares estimator
addressing multicollinearity under multicollinearity two or more of the covariates are highly correlated so that one can be linearly predicted from the others with non trivial degree of accuracy
consequently the columns of the data matrix that correspond to the observations for these covariates tend to become linearly dependent and therefore tends to become rank deficient losing its full column rank structure
more quantitatively one or more of the smaller eigenvalues of get very close or become exactly equal to under such situations
the variance expressions above indicate that these small eigenvalues have the maximum inflation effect on the variance of the least squares estimator thereby destabilizing the estimator significantly when they are close to this issue can be effectively addressed through using pcr estimator obtained by excluding the principal components corresponding to these small eigenvalues
dimension reduction pcr may also be used for performing dimension reduction
to see this let denote any matrix having orthonormal columns for any
suppose now that we want to approximate each of the covariate observations through the rank linear transformation for some
then it can be shown that is minimized at the matrix with the first principal component directions as columns and the corresponding dimensional derived covariates
thus the dimensional principal components provide the best linear approximation of rank to the observed data matrix the corresponding reconstruction error is given by thus any potential dimension reduction may be achieved by choosing the number of principal components to be used through appropriate thresholding on the cumulative sum of the eigenvalues of since the smaller eigenvalues do not contribute significantly to the cumulative sum the corresponding principal components may be continued to be dropped as long as the desired threshold limit is not exceeded
the same criteria may also be used for addressing the multicollinearity issue whereby the principal components corresponding to the smaller eigenvalues may be ignored as long as the threshold limit is maintained
regularization effect since the pcr estimator typically uses only subset of all the principal components for regression it can be viewed as some sort of regularized procedure
more specifically for any the pcr estimator denotes the regularized solution to the following constrained minimization problem min subject to
the constraint may be equivalently written as where
thus when only proper subset of all the principal components are selected for regression the pcr estimator so obtained is based on hard form of regularization that constrains the resulting solution to the column space of the selected principal component directions and consequently restricts it to be orthogonal to the excluded directions
optimality of pcr among class of regularized estimators given the constrained minimization problem as defined above consider the following generalized version of it min subject to where denotes any full column rank matrix of order with let denote the corresponding solution
thus arg min subject to then the optimal choice of the restriction matrix for which the corresponding estimator achieves the minimum prediction error is given by where diag
quite clearly the resulting optimal estimator is then simply given by the pcr estimator based on the first principal components
efficiency since the ordinary least squares estimator is unbiased for we have var mse where mse denotes the mean squared error
now if for some we additionally have then the corresponding is also unbiased for and therefore var mse
we have already seen that var var which then implies mse mse for that particular thus in that case the corresponding would be more efficient estimator of compared to based on using the mean squared error as the performance criteria
in addition any given linear form of the corresponding would also have lower mean squared error compared to that of the same linear form of now suppose that for given then the corresponding is biased for however since var var it is still possible that mse mse especially if is such that the excluded principal components correspond to the smaller eigenvalues thereby resulting in lower bias
in order to ensure efficient estimation and prediction performance of pcr as an estimator of park proposes the following guideline for selecting the principal components to be used for regression drop the principal component if and only if practical implementation of this guideline of course requires estimates for the unknown model parameters and in general they may be estimated using the unrestricted least squares estimates obtained from the original full model
park however provides slightly modified set of estimates that may be better suited for this purpose unlike the criteria based on the cumulative sum of the eigenvalues of which is probably more suited for addressing the multicollinearity problem and for performing dimension reduction the above criteria actually attempts to improve the prediction and estimation efficiency of the pcr estimator by involving both the outcome as well as the covariates in the process of selecting the principal components to be used in the regression step
alternative approaches with similar goals include selection of the principal components based on cross validation or the mallow cp criteria
often the principal components are also selected based on their degree of association with the outcome
shrinkage effect of pcr in general pcr is essentially shrinkage estimator that usually retains the high variance principal components corresponding to the higher eigenvalues of as covariates in the model and discards the remaining low variance components corresponding to the lower eigenvalues of
thus it exerts discrete shrinkage effect on the low variance components nullifying their contribution completely in the original model
in contrast the ridge regression estimator exerts smooth shrinkage effect through the regularization parameter or the tuning parameter inherently involved in its construction
while it does not completely discard any of the components it exerts shrinkage effect over all of them in continuous manner so that the extent of shrinkage is higher for the low variance components and lower for the high variance components
frank and friedman conclude that for the purpose of prediction itself the ridge estimator owing to its smooth shrinkage effect is perhaps better choice compared to the pcr estimator having discrete shrinkage effect
in addition the principal components are obtained from the eigen decomposition of that involves the observations for the explanatory variables only
therefore the resulting pcr estimator obtained from using these principal components as covariates need not necessarily have satisfactory predictive performance for the outcome
somewhat similar estimator that tries to address this issue through its very construction is the partial least squares pls estimator
similar to pcr pls also uses derived covariates of lower dimensions
however unlike pcr the derived covariates for pls are obtained based on using both the outcome as well as the covariates
while pcr seeks the high variance directions in the space of the covariates pls seeks the directions in the covariate space that are most useful for the prediction of the outcome
variant of the classical pcr known as the supervised pcr was proposed
in spirit similar to that of pls it attempts at obtaining derived covariates of lower dimensions based on criterion that involves both the outcome as well as the covariates
the method starts by performing set of simple linear regressions or univariate regressions wherein the outcome vector is regressed separately on each of the covariates taken one at time
then for some the first covariates that turn out to be the most correlated with the outcome based on the degree of significance of the corresponding estimated regression coefficients are selected for further use
conventional pcr as described earlier is then performed but now it is based on only the data matrix corresponding to the observations for the selected covariates
the number of covariates used and the subsequent number of principal components used are usually selected by cross validation
generalization to kernel settings the classical pcr method as described above is based on classical pca and considers linear regression model for predicting the outcome based on the covariates
however it can be easily generalized to kernel machine setting whereby the regression function need not necessarily be linear in the covariates but instead it can belong to the reproducing kernel hilbert space associated with any arbitrary possibly non linear symmetric positive definite kernel
the linear regression model turns out to be special case of this setting when the kernel function is chosen to be the linear kernel
in general under the kernel machine setting the vector of covariates is first mapped into high dimensional potentially infinite dimensional feature space characterized by the kernel function chosen
the mapping so obtained is known as the feature map and each of its coordinates also known as the feature elements corresponds to one feature may be linear or non linear of the covariates
the regression function is then assumed to be linear combination of these feature elements
thus the underlying regression model in the kernel machine setting is essentially linear regression model with the understanding that instead of the original set of covariates the predictors are now given by the vector potentially infinite dimensional of feature elements obtained by transforming the actual covariates using the feature map
however the kernel trick actually enables us to operate in the feature space without ever explicitly computing the feature map
it turns out that it is only sufficient to compute the pairwise inner products among the feature maps for the observed covariate vectors and these inner products are simply given by the values of the kernel function evaluated at the corresponding pairs of covariate vectors
the pairwise inner products so obtained may therefore be represented in the form of symmetric non negative definite matrix also known as the kernel matrix
pcr in the kernel machine setting can now be implemented by first appropriately centering this kernel matrix say with respect to the feature space and then performing kernel pca on the centered kernel matrix say whereby an eigendecomposition of is obtained
kernel pcr then proceeds by usually selecting subset of all the eigenvectors so obtained and then performing standard linear regression of the outcome vector on these selected eigenvectors
the eigenvectors to be used for regression are usually selected using cross validation
the estimated regression coefficients having the same dimension as the number of selected eigenvectors along with the corresponding selected eigenvectors are then used for predicting the outcome for future observation
in machine learning this technique is also known as spectral regression
clearly kernel pcr has discrete shrinkage effect on the eigenvectors of quite similar to the discrete shrinkage effect of classical pcr on the principal components as discussed earlier
however the feature map associated with the chosen kernel could potentially be infinite dimensional and hence the corresponding principal components and principal component directions could be infinite dimensional as well
therefore these quantities are often practically intractable under the kernel machine setting
kernel pcr essentially works around this problem by considering an equivalent dual formulation based on using the spectral decomposition of the associated kernel matrix
under the linear regression model which corresponds to choosing the kernel function as the linear kernel this amounts to considering spectral decomposition of the corresponding kernel matrix and then regressing the outcome vector on selected subset of the eigenvectors of so obtained
it can be easily shown that this is the same as regressing the outcome vector on the corresponding principal components which are finite dimensional in this case as defined in the context of the classical pcr
thus for the linear kernel the kernel pcr based on dual formulation is exactly equivalent to the classical pcr based on primal formulation
however for arbitrary and possibly non linear kernels this primal formulation may become intractable owing to the infinite dimensionality of the associated feature map
thus classical pcr becomes practically infeasible in that case but kernel pcr based on the dual formulation still remains valid and computationally scalable

in linear algebra the singular value decomposition svd is factorization of real or complex matrix
it generalizes the eigendecomposition of square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any matrix
it is related to the polar decomposition
specifically the singular value decomposition of an complex matrix is factorization of the form where is an complex unitary matrix is an rectangular diagonal matrix with non negative real numbers on the diagonal is an complex unitary matrix and is the conjugate transpose of such decomposition always exists for any complex matrix
if is real then and can be guaranteed to be real orthogonal matrices in such contexts the svd is often denoted the diagonal entries of are uniquely determined by and are known as the singular values of the number of non zero singular values is equal to the rank of the columns of and the columns of are called left singular vectors and right singular vectors of respectively
they form two sets of orthonormal bases um and vn and if they are sorted so that the singular values with value zero are all in the highest numbered columns or rows the singular value decomposition can be written as where min is the rank of the svd is not unique
it is always possible to choose the decomposition so that the singular values are in descending order
in this case but not and is uniquely determined by the term sometimes refers to the compact svd similar decomposition in which is square diagonal of size where min is the rank of and has only the non zero singular values
in this variant is an semi unitary matrix and is an semi unitary matrix such that mathematical applications of the svd include computing the pseudoinverse matrix approximation and determining the rank range and null space of matrix
the svd is also extremely useful in all areas of science engineering and statistics such as signal processing least squares fitting of data and process control
intuitive interpretations rotation coordinate scaling and reflection in the special case when is an real square matrix the matrices and can be chosen to be real matrices too
in that case unitary is the same as orthogonal
then interpreting both unitary matrices as well as the diagonal matrix summarized here as as linear transformation ax of the space rm the matrices and represent rotations or reflection of the space while represents the scaling of each coordinate xi by the factor
thus the svd decomposition breaks down any linear transformation of rm into composition of three geometrical transformations rotation or reflection followed by coordinate by coordinate scaling followed by another rotation or reflection
in particular if has positive determinant then and can be chosen to be both rotations with reflections or both rotations without reflections
if the determinant is negative exactly one of them will have reflection
if the determinant is zero each can be independently chosen to be of either type
if the matrix is real but not square namely with it can be interpreted as linear transformation from rn to rm
then and can be chosen to be rotations reflections of rm and rn respectively and besides scaling the first min coordinates also extends the vector with zeros
removes trailing coordinates so as to turn rn into rm
singular values as semiaxes of an ellipse or ellipsoid as shown in the figure the singular values can be interpreted as the magnitude of the semiaxes of an ellipse in
this concept can be generalized to dimensional euclidean space with the singular values of any square matrix being viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an dimensional ellipsoid
similarly the singular values of any matrix can be viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an dimensional ellipsoid in dimensional space for example as an ellipse in tilted plane in space
singular values encode magnitude of the semiaxis while singular vectors encode direction
see below for further details
the columns of and are orthonormal bases since and are unitary the columns of each of them form set of orthonormal vectors which can be regarded as basis vectors
the matrix maps the basis vector vi to the stretched unit vector ui
by the definition of unitary matrix the same is true for their conjugate transposes and except the geometric interpretation of the singular values as stretches is lost
in short the columns of and are orthonormal bases
when the is positive semidefinite hermitian matrix and are both equal to the unitary matrix used to diagonalize however when is not positive semidefinite and hermitian but still diagonalizable its eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition are distinct
geometric meaning because and are unitary we know that the columns um of yield an orthonormal basis of km and the columns vn of yield an orthonormal basis of kn with respect to the standard scalar products on these spaces
the linear transformation has particularly simple description with respect to these orthonormal bases we have min where is the th diagonal entry of and vi for min
the geometric content of the svd theorem can thus be summarized as follows for every linear map kn km one can find orthonormal bases of kn and km such that maps the th basis vector of kn to non negative multiple of the th basis vector of km and sends the left over basis vectors to zero
with respect to these bases the map is therefore represented by diagonal matrix with non negative real diagonal entries
to get more visual flavor of singular values and svd factorization at least when working on real vector spaces consider the sphere of radius one in rn
the linear map maps this sphere onto an ellipsoid in rm
non zero singular values are simply the lengths of the semi axes of this ellipsoid
especially when and all the singular values are distinct and non zero the svd of the linear map can be easily analyzed as succession of three consecutive moves consider the ellipsoid and specifically its axes then consider the directions in rn sent by onto these axes
these directions happen to be mutually orthogonal
apply first an isometry sending these directions to the coordinate axes of rn
on second move apply an endomorphism diagonalized along the coordinate axes and stretching or shrinking in each direction using the semi axes lengths of as stretching coefficients
the composition then sends the unit sphere onto an ellipsoid isometric to
to define the third and last move apply an isometry to this ellipsoid to obtain
as can be easily checked the composition coincides with example consider the matrix singular value decomposition of this matrix is given by the scaling matrix is zero outside of the diagonal grey italics and one diagonal element is zero red bold
furthermore because the matrices and are unitary multiplying by their respective conjugate transposes yields identity matrices as shown below
in this case because and are real valued each is an orthogonal matrix
this particular singular value decomposition is not unique
choosing such that is also valid singular value decomposition
svd and spectral decomposition singular values singular vectors and their relation to the svd non negative real number is singular value for if and only if there exist unit length vectors in km and in kn such that and the vectors and are called left singular and right singular vectors for respectively
in any singular value decomposition the diagonal entries of are equal to the singular values of the first min columns of and are respectively left and right singular vectors for the corresponding singular values
consequently the above theorem implies that an matrix has at most distinct singular values
it is always possible to find unitary basis for km with subset of basis vectors spanning the left singular vectors of each singular value of it is always possible to find unitary basis for kn with subset of basis vectors spanning the right singular vectors of each singular value of singular value for which we can find two left or right singular vectors that are linearly independent is called degenerate
if and are two left singular vectors which both correspond to the singular value then any normalized linear combination of the two vectors is also left singular vector corresponding to the singular value the similar statement is true for right singular vectors
the number of independent left and right singular vectors coincides and these singular vectors appear in the same columns of and corresponding to diagonal elements of all with the same value as an exception the left and right singular vectors of singular value comprise all unit vectors in the kernel and cokernel respectively of which by the rank nullity theorem cannot be the same dimension if even if all singular values are nonzero if then the cokernel is nontrivial in which case is padded with orthogonal vectors from the cokernel
conversely if then is padded by orthogonal vectors from the kernel
however if the singular value of exists the extra columns of or already appear as left or right singular vectors
non degenerate singular values always have unique left and right singular vectors up to multiplication by unit phase factor ei for the real case up to sign
consequently if all singular values of square matrix are non degenerate and non zero then its singular value decomposition is unique up to multiplication of column of by unit phase factor and simultaneous multiplication of the corresponding column of by the same unit phase factor
in general the svd is unique up to arbitrary unitary transformations applied uniformly to the column vectors of both and spanning the subspaces of each singular value and up to arbitrary unitary transformations on vectors of and spanning the kernel and cokernel respectively of relation to eigenvalue decomposition the singular value decomposition is very general in the sense that it can be applied to any matrix whereas eigenvalue decomposition can only be applied to diagonalizable matrices
nevertheless the two decompositions are related
given an svd of as described above the following two relations hold the right hand sides of these relations describe the eigenvalue decompositions of the left hand sides
consequently the columns of right singular vectors are eigenvectors of
the columns of left singular vectors are eigenvectors of mm
the non zero elements of non zero singular values are the square roots of the non zero eigenvalues of or mm in the special case that is normal matrix which by definition must be square the spectral theorem says that it can be unitarily diagonalized using basis of eigenvectors so that it can be written udu for unitary matrix and diagonal matrix with complex elements along the diagonal
when is positive semi definite will be non negative real numbers so that the decomposition udu is also singular value decomposition
otherwise it can be recast as an svd by moving the phase ei of each to either its corresponding vi or ui
the natural connection of the svd to non normal matrices is through the polar decomposition theorem sr where is positive semidefinite and normal and uv is unitary
thus except for positive semi definite matrices the eigenvalue decomposition and svd of while related differ the eigenvalue decomposition is udu where is not necessarily unitary and is not necessarily positive semi definite while the svd is where is diagonal and positive semi definite and and are unitary matrices that are not necessarily related except through the matrix while only non defective square matrices have an eigenvalue decomposition any matrix has svd
applications of the svd pseudoinverse the singular value decomposition can be used for computing the pseudoinverse of matrix
various authors use different notation for the pseudoinverse here we use
indeed the pseudoinverse of the matrix with singular value decomposition is where is the pseudoinverse of which is formed by replacing every non zero diagonal entry by its reciprocal and transposing the resulting matrix
the pseudoinverse is one way to solve linear least squares problems
solving homogeneous linear equations set of homogeneous linear equations can be written as ax for matrix and vector typical situation is that is known and non zero is to be determined which satisfies the equation
such an belongs to null space and is sometimes called right null vector of the vector can be characterized as right singular vector corresponding to singular value of that is zero
this observation means that if is square matrix and has no vanishing singular value the equation has no non zero as solution
it also means that if there are several vanishing singular values any linear combination of the corresponding right singular vectors is valid solution
analogously to the definition of right null vector non zero satisfying with denoting the conjugate transpose of is called left null vector of
total least squares minimization total least squares problem seeks the vector that minimizes the norm of vector ax under the constraint the solution turns out to be the right singular vector of corresponding to the smallest singular value
range null space and rank another application of the svd is that it provides an explicit representation of the range and null space of matrix the right singular vectors corresponding to vanishing singular values of span the null space of and the left singular vectors corresponding to the non zero singular values of span the range of for example in the above example the null space is spanned by the last two rows of and the range is spanned by the first three columns of as consequence the rank of equals the number of non zero singular values which is the same as the number of non zero diagonal elements in in numerical linear algebra the singular values can be used to determine the effective rank of matrix as rounding error may lead to small but non zero singular values in rank deficient matrix
singular values beyond significant gap are assumed to be numerically equivalent to zero
low rank matrix approximation some practical applications need to solve the problem of approximating matrix with another matrix said to be truncated which has specific rank in the case that the approximation is based on minimizing the frobenius norm of the difference between and under the constraint that rank it turns out that the solution is given by the svd of namely where is the same matrix as except that it contains only the largest singular values the other singular values are replaced by zero
this is known as the eckart young theorem as it was proved by those two authors in although it was later found to have been known to earlier authors see stewart
separable models the svd can be thought of as decomposing matrix into weighted ordered sum of separable matrices
by separable we mean that matrix can be written as an outer product of two vectors or in coordinates specifically the matrix can be decomposed as here ui and vi are the th columns of the corresponding svd matrices are the ordered singular values and each ai is separable
the svd can be used to find the decomposition of an image processing filter into separable horizontal and vertical filters
note that the number of non zero is exactly the rank of the matrix
separable models often arise in biological systems and the svd factorization is useful to analyze such systems
for example some visual area simple cells receptive fields can be well described by gabor filter in the space domain multiplied by modulation function in the time domain
thus given linear filter evaluated through for example reverse correlation one can rearrange the two spatial dimensions into one dimension thus yielding two dimensional filter space time which can be decomposed through svd
the first column of in the svd factorization is then gabor while the first column of represents the time modulation or vice versa
one may then define an index of separability which is the fraction of the power in the matrix which is accounted for by the first separable matrix in the decomposition
nearest orthogonal matrix it is possible to use the svd of square matrix to determine the orthogonal matrix closest to the closeness of fit is measured by the frobenius norm of the solution is the product uv
this intuitively makes sense because an orthogonal matrix would have the decomposition uiv where is the identity matrix so that if then the product uv amounts to replacing the singular values with ones
equivalently the solution is the unitary matrix uv of the polar decomposition rp in either order of stretch and rotation as described above
similar problem with interesting applications in shape analysis is the orthogonal procrustes problem which consists of finding an orthogonal matrix which most closely maps to specifically argmin subject to where denotes the frobenius norm
this problem is equivalent to finding the nearest orthogonal matrix to given matrix atb
the kabsch algorithm the kabsch algorithm called wahba problem in other fields uses svd to compute the optimal rotation with respect to least squares minimization that will align set of points with corresponding set of points
it is used among other applications to compare the structures of molecules
signal processing the svd and pseudoinverse have been successfully applied to signal processing image processing and big data in genomic signal processing
other examples the svd is also applied extensively to the study of linear inverse problems and is useful in the analysis of regularization methods such as that of tikhonov
it is widely used in statistics where it is related to principal component analysis and to correspondence analysis and in signal processing and pattern recognition
it is also used in output only modal analysis where the non scaled mode shapes can be determined from the singular vectors
yet another usage is latent semantic indexing in natural language text processing
in general numerical computation involving linear or linearized systems there is universal constant that characterizes the regularity or singularity of problem which is the system condition number max min
it often controls the error rate or convergence rate of given computational scheme on such systems the svd also plays crucial role in the field of quantum information in form often referred to as the schmidt decomposition
through it states of two quantum systems are naturally decomposed providing necessary and sufficient condition for them to be entangled if the rank of the matrix is larger than one
one application of svd to rather large matrices is in numerical weather prediction where lanczos methods are used to estimate the most linearly quickly growing few perturbations to the central numerical weather prediction over given initial forward time period the singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of the linearized propagator for the global weather over that time interval
the output singular vectors in this case are entire weather systems
these perturbations are then run through the full nonlinear model to generate an ensemble forecast giving handle on some of the uncertainty that should be allowed for around the current central prediction
svd has also been applied to reduced order modelling
the aim of reduced order modelling is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in complex system which is to be modeled
svd was coupled with radial basis functions to interpolate solutions to three dimensional unsteady flow problems interestingly svd has been used to improve gravitational waveform modeling by the ground based gravitational wave interferometer aligo
svd can help to increase the accuracy and speed of waveform generation to support gravitational waves searches and update two different waveform models
singular value decomposition is used in recommender systems to predict people item ratings
distributed algorithms have been developed for the purpose of calculating the svd on clusters of commodity machines low rank svd has been applied for hotspot detection from spatiotemporal data with application to disease outbreak detection
combination of svd and higher order svd also has been applied for real time event detection from complex data streams multivariate data with space and time dimensions in disease surveillance
existence proofs an eigenvalue of matrix is characterized by the algebraic relation mu
when is hermitian variational characterization is also available
let be real symmetric matrix
define by the extreme value theorem this continuous function attains maximum at some when restricted to the unit sphere
by the lagrange multipliers theorem necessarily satisfies for some real number the nabla symbol is the del operator differentiation with respect to
using the symmetry of we obtain therefore mu so is unit length eigenvector of for every unit length eigenvector of its eigenvalue is so is the largest eigenvalue of the same calculation performed on the orthogonal complement of gives the next largest eigenvalue and so on
the complex hermitian case is similar there is real valued function of real variables
singular values are similar in that they can be described algebraically or from variational principles
although unlike the eigenvalue case hermiticity or symmetry of is no longer required
this section gives these two arguments for existence of singular value decomposition
based on the spectral theorem let be an complex matrix
since is positive semi definite and hermitian by the spectral theorem there exists an unitary matrix such that where is diagonal and positive definite of dimension with the number of non zero eigenvalues of which can be shown to verify min
note that is here by definition matrix whose th column is the th eigenvector of corresponding to the eigenvalue moreover the th column of for is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue this can be expressed by writing as where the columns of and therefore contain the eigenvectors of corresponding to non zero and zero eigenvalues respectively
using this rewriting of the equation becomes
this implies that moreover the second equation implies finally the unitary ness of translates in terms of and into the following conditions where the subscripts on the identity matrices are used to remark that they are of different dimensions
let us now define then since this can be also seen as immediate consequence of the fact that this is equivalent to the observation that if is the set of eigenvectors of corresponding to non vanishing eigenvalues then is set of orthogonal vectors and is generally not complete set of orthonormal vectors
this matches with the matrix formalism used above denoting with the matrix whose columns are with the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of with vanishing eigenvalue and the matrix whose columns are the vectors we see that this is almost the desired result except that and are in general not unitary since they might not be square
however we do know that the number of rows of is no smaller than the number of columns since the dimensions of is no greater than and also since the columns in are orthonormal and can be extended to an orthonormal basis
this means that we can choose such that is unitary
for we already have to make it unitary
now define where extra zero rows are added or removed to make the number of zero rows equal the number of columns of and hence the overall dimensions of equal to then which is the desired result
notice the argument could begin with diagonalizing mm rather than this shows directly that mm and have the same non zero eigenvalues
based on variational characterization the singular values can also be characterized as the maxima of utmv considered as function of and over particular subspaces
the singular vectors are the values of and where these maxima are attained
let denote an matrix with real entries
let sk be the unit sphere in and define consider the function restricted to sm sn
since both sm and sn are compact sets their product is also compact
furthermore since is continuous it attains largest value for at least one pair of vectors sm and sn
this largest value is denoted and the corresponding vectors are denoted and
since is the largest value of it must be non negative
if it were negative changing the sign of either or would make it positive and therefore larger
are left and right singular vectors of with corresponding singular value
similar to the eigenvalues case by assumption the two vectors satisfy the lagrange multiplier equation after some algebra this becomes multiplying the first equation from left by and the second equation from left by and taking into account gives plugging this into the pair of equations above we have this proves the statement
more singular vectors and singular values can be found by maximizing over normalized which are orthogonal to and respectively
the passage from real to complex is similar to the eigenvalue case
calculating the svd the singular value decomposition can be computed using the following observations the left singular vectors of are set of orthonormal eigenvectors of mm
the right singular vectors of are set of orthonormal eigenvectors of
the non zero singular values of found on the diagonal entries of are the square roots of the non zero eigenvalues of both and mm
numerical approach the svd of matrix is typically computed by two step procedure
in the first step the matrix is reduced to bidiagonal matrix
this takes mn floating point operations flop assuming that the second step is to compute the svd of the bidiagonal matrix
this step can only be done with an iterative method as with eigenvalue algorithms
however in practice it suffices to compute the svd up to certain precision like the machine epsilon
if this precision is considered constant then the second step takes iterations each costing flops
thus the first step is more expensive and the overall cost is mn flops trefethen bau iii lecture
the first step can be done using householder reflections for cost of mn flops assuming that only the singular values are needed and not the singular vectors
if is much larger than then it is advantageous to first reduce the matrix to triangular matrix with the qr decomposition and then use householder reflections to further reduce the matrix to bidiagonal form the combined cost is mn flops trefethen bau iii lecture
the second step can be done by variant of the qr algorithm for the computation of eigenvalues which was first described by golub kahan
the lapack subroutine dbdsqr implements this iterative method with some modifications to cover the case where the singular values are very small demmel kahan
together with first step using householder reflections and if appropriate qr decomposition this forms the dgesvd routine for the computation of the singular value decomposition
the same algorithm is implemented in the gnu scientific library gsl
the gsl also offers an alternative method that uses one sided jacobi orthogonalization in step gsl team
this method computes the svd of the bidiagonal matrix by solving sequence of svd problems similar to how the jacobi eigenvalue algorithm solves sequence of eigenvalue methods golub van loan
yet another method for step uses the idea of divide and conquer eigenvalue algorithms trefethen bau iii lecture
there is an alternative way that does not explicitly use the eigenvalue decomposition
usually the singular value problem of matrix is converted into an equivalent symmetric eigenvalue problem such as or
the approaches that use eigenvalue decompositions are based on the qr algorithm which is well developed to be stable and fast
note that the singular values are real and right and left singular vectors are not required to form similarity transformations
one can iteratively alternate between the qr decomposition and the lq decomposition to find the real diagonal hermitian matrices
the qr decomposition gives and the lq decomposition of gives
thus at every iteration we have update and repeat the orthogonalizations
eventually this iteration between qr decomposition and lq decomposition produces left and right unitary singular matrices
this approach cannot readily be accelerated as the qr algorithm can with spectral shifts or deflation
this is because the shift method is not easily defined without using similarity transformations
however this iterative approach is very simple to implement so is good choice when speed does not matter
this method also provides insight into how purely orthogonal unitary transformations can obtain the svd
analytic result of svd the singular values of matrix can be found analytically
let the matrix be where are complex numbers that parameterize the matrix is the identity matrix and denote the pauli matrices
then its two singular values are given by re re re im im im reduced svds in applications it is quite unusual for the full svd including full unitary decomposition of the null space of the matrix to be required
instead it is often sufficient as well as faster and more economical for storage to compute reduced version of the svd
the following can be distinguished for an matrix of rank thin svd the thin or economy sized svd of matrix is given by where min the matrices uk and vk contain only the first columns of and and contains only the first singular values from the matrix uk is thus is diagonal and vk is
the thin svd uses significantly less space and computation time if max
the first stage in its calculation will usually be qr decomposition of which can make for significantly quicker calculation in this case
compact svd only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the non zero singular values are calculated
the remaining vectors of and are not calculated
this is quicker and more economical than the thin svd if min
the matrix ur is thus is diagonal and vr is
truncated svd in many applications the number of the non zero singular values is large making even the compact svd impractical to compute
in such cases the smallest singular values may need to be truncated to compute only non zero singular values
the truncated svd is no longer an exact decomposition of the original matrix but rather provides the optimal low rank matrix approximation by any matrix of fixed rank where matrix ut is is diagonal and vt is
only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the largest singular values are calculated
this can be much quicker and more economical than the compact svd if but requires completely different toolset of numerical solvers
in applications that require an approximation to the moore penrose inverse of the matrix the smallest singular values of are of interest which are more challenging to compute compared to the largest ones
truncated svd is employed in latent semantic indexing
norms ky fan norms the sum of the largest singular values of is matrix norm the ky fan norm of the first of the ky fan norms the ky fan norm is the same as the operator norm of as linear operator with respect to the euclidean norms of km and kn
in other words the ky fan norm is the operator norm induced by the standard euclidean inner product
for this reason it is also called the operator norm
one can easily verify the relationship between the ky fan norm and singular values
it is true in general for bounded operator on possibly infinite dimensional hilbert spaces but in the matrix case is normal matrix so is the largest eigenvalue of
the largest singular value of the last of the ky fan norms the sum of all singular values is the trace norm also known as the nuclear norm defined by tr the eigenvalues of are the squares of the singular values
hilbert schmidt norm the singular values are related to another norm on the space of operators
consider the hilbert schmidt inner product on the matrices defined by tr
so the induced norm is tr
since the trace is invariant under unitary equivalence this shows where are the singular values of this is called the frobenius norm schatten norm or hilbert schmidt norm of direct calculation shows that the frobenius norm of mij coincides with in addition the frobenius norm and the trace norm the nuclear norm are special cases of the schatten norm
variations and generalizations mode representation can be represented using mode multiplication of matrix applying then on the result that is tensor svd two types of tensor decompositions exist which generalise the svd to multi way arrays
one of them decomposes tensor into sum of rank tensors which is called tensor rank decomposition
the second type of decomposition computes the orthonormal subspaces associated with the different factors appearing in the tensor product of vector spaces in which the tensor lives
this decomposition is referred to in the literature as the higher order svd hosvd or tucker tuckerm
in addition multilinear principal component analysis in multilinear subspace learning involves the same mathematical operations as tucker decomposition being used in different context of dimensionality reduction
scale invariant svd the singular values of matrix are uniquely defined and are invariant with respect to left and or right unitary transformations of in other words the singular values of uav for unitary and are equal to the singular values of this is an important property for applications in which it is necessary to preserve euclidean distances and invariance with respect to rotations
the scale invariant svd or si svd is analogous to the conventional svd except that its uniquely determined singular values are invariant with respect to diagonal transformations of in other words the singular values of dae for invertible diagonal matrices and are equal to the singular values of this is an important property for applications for which invariance to the choice of units on variables metric versus imperial units is needed
higher order svd of functions hosvd tensor product tp model transformation numerically reconstruct the hosvd of functions
for further details please visit tensor product model transformation hosvd based canonical form of tp functions and qlpv models tp model transformation in control theory bounded operators on hilbert spaces the factorization can be extended to bounded operator on separable hilbert space namely for any bounded operator there exist partial isometry unitary measure space and non negative measurable such that where is the multiplication by on
this can be shown by mimicking the linear algebraic argument for the matricial case above
vtfv is the unique positive square root of as given by the borel functional calculus for self adjoint operators
the reason why need not be unitary is because unlike the finite dimensional case given an isometry with nontrivial kernel suitable may not be found such that is unitary operator
as for matrices the singular value factorization is equivalent to the polar decomposition for operators we can simply write and notice that is still partial isometry while vtfv is positive
singular values and compact operators the notion of singular values and left right singular vectors can be extended to compact operator on hilbert space as they have discrete spectrum
if is compact every non zero in its spectrum is an eigenvalue
furthermore compact self adjoint operator can be diagonalized by its eigenvectors
if is compact so is
applying the diagonalization result the unitary image of its positive square root tf has set of orthonormal eigenvectors
for any where the series converges in the norm topology on notice how this resembles the expression from the finite dimensional case
are called the singular values of can be considered the left singular resp
right singular vectors of compact operators on hilbert space are the closure of finite rank operators in the uniform operator topology
the above series expression gives an explicit such representation
an immediate consequence of this is theorem
is compact if and only if is compact
history the singular value decomposition was originally developed by differential geometers who wished to determine whether real bilinear form could be made equal to another by independent orthogonal transformations of the two spaces it acts on
eugenio beltrami and camille jordan discovered independently in and respectively that the singular values of the bilinear forms represented as matrix form complete set of invariants for bilinear forms under orthogonal substitutions
james joseph sylvester also arrived at the singular value decomposition for real square matrices in apparently independently of both beltrami and jordan
sylvester called the singular values the canonical multipliers of the matrix the fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is autonne in who arrived at it via the polar decomposition
the first proof of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by carl eckart and gale young in they saw it as generalization of the principal axis transformation for hermitian matrices
in erhard schmidt defined an analog of singular values for integral operators which are compact under some weak technical assumptions it seems he was unaware of the parallel work on singular values of finite matrices
this theory was further developed by mile picard in who is the first to call the numbers singular values or in french valeurs singuli res
practical methods for computing the svd date back to kogbetliantz in and hestenes in resembling closely the jacobi eigenvalue algorithm which uses plane rotations or givens rotations
however these were replaced by the method of gene golub and william kahan published in which uses householder transformations or reflections
in golub and christian reinsch published variant of the golub kahan algorithm that is still the one most used today

the episode aired on nbc in the united states on february
after hours was written by co executive producers halsted sullivan and warren lieberstein and directed by brian baumgartner who portrays kevin malone on the series marking his directorial debut
the series presented as if it were real documentary depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the scranton pennsylvania branch of the fictional dunder mifflin paper company
in the episode dwight schrute rainn wilson and todd packer david koechner compete for job
meanwhile jim halpert john krasinski has to deal with cathy sexual advances in his hotel room
also andy bernard ed helms has everyone stay late to cover for their co workers in florida
after hours received mixed reviews from critics
according to the nielsen media research after hours was viewed by an estimated million viewers and received rating share among adults between the ages of and marking rise in the ratings from the series low ratings of the previous episode tallahassee
the episode also ranked as the highest rated nbc program of the night
synopsis dwight schrute rainn wilson and todd packer david koechner compete to become vp under nellie bertram catherine tate by seducing her after work at the hotel bar
for most of the night packer seems to be the most successful so dwight has gabe lewis zach woods keep nellie distracted while dwight helps jim halpert john krasinski with something in his hotel room
gabe takes it upon himself to spike packer beer with his asthma inhaler which causes packer to vomit on gabe pants and leaves dwight alone with nellie
dwight eventually succeeds in seducing nellie as she asks for key to his room
upon kissing her and realizing that what he is doing is wrong dwight secretly scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to nellie stating the seduction was only to gain approval
in scranton andy bernard ed helms has everyone stay late to cover for their co workers in florida which turns into an awkward situation when val ameenah kaplan boyfriend brandon jerry minor arrives with jamaican food andy ordered and accuses darryl philbin craig robinson of having an affair with her after having read darryl text messages to her
kelly kapoor mindy kaling demands that darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest
upon hearing them most of the staff agree that his text messages particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one are suggestive of darryl wanting to be with val
val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with darryl is ridiculous
pam halpert jenna fischer and andy each advise darryl on what jim would do while andy suggest he wait pam says that if jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged she never would have ended up marrying him
darryl follows pam advice and tells val that potential relationship is not ridiculous
erin hannon ellie kemper confides in ryan howard novak that she is intending to stay in tallahassee
ryan interprets this as an invitation to hook up with her so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make waffle she unsuccessfully ordered
they hide under table when the chefs return
after ryan compliments erin she suggests that they could become roommates in florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them
not wanting that long timeline he begrudgingly resorts to saying he loves kelly
jim has started spending more time with cathy simms lindsey broad because stanley hudson leslie david baker keeps trying to rope jim into having an affair
during the night at the hotel cathy asks to hang out for while in jim room under the pretext that the heat in her room is malfunctioning
she repeatedly makes seductive signals making jim uncomfortable
stanley is no help so he calls dwight saying he has bed bugs
fearing that the bugs will transfer onto dwight himself dwight arrives and forces cathy off jim bed so he can lure out the bed bugs with his nearly naked body
this fails to sufficiently disgust cathy who merely steps into the bathroom to take shower until dwight leaves
cathy gets out of the shower wearing only bath robe
after ordering some desserts from room service and asking jim to touch her legs he finally comes out saying that he is happily married and does not want to be with her
cathy gets defensive and insists that she did not have any romantic intentions whatsoever so jim relents but cathy immediately resumes her seductive technique
after jim goes to the bathroom he comes out to find her in only her underwear under his blanket
fed up he demands that she leave and lets dwight armed with spray chemicals into the room
jim claims to see bed bug near cathy making her flee from dwight spraying
however because of the chemicals dwight suggests jim sleep in cathy room
jim instead spends the night with dwight in his room eating cathy desserts and watching tv while drunken nellie tries unsuccessfully to get in
production after hours was written by co executive producers halsted sullivan and warren lieberstein
it was directed by brian baumgartner who portrays kevin malone on the series marking his directorial debut
the episode features guest appearance from david koechner who appears as todd packer in the series
he recently made deal with nbc to do more episodes for the series and also possibly join the cast of series developer greg daniels next series friday night dinner an adaption of the british series of the same name
the episode marks the tenth appearance of lindsey broad who plays cathy pam replacement during her maternity leave
she appeared in recurring role for the season after she initially appeared in pam replacement
the season eight dvd contains number of deleted scenes from this episode
notable cut scenes include nellie establishing boundaries for flirtation nellie and dwight confessing peculiar secrets to each other and pam and andy calling jim for advice only to have cathy answer the phone
reception ratings after hours originally aired on nbc in the united states on february the episode was viewed by an estimated million viewers and received rating share among adults between the ages of and this means that it was seen by of all to year olds and of all to year olds watching television at the time of the broadcast
this marked percent rise in the ratings from the previous episode tallahassee
the episode finished third in its time slot being beaten by grey anatomy which received rating share and the cbs drama person of interest which received rating share in the demographic
the episode beat the cw drama series the secret circle and the fox drama series the finder
despite this after hours was the highest rated nbc television episode of the night
it was also the last episode of the office to be viewed by more than million viewers until the series finale year later
reviews after hours received mixed reviews from critics
hitfix writer alan sepinwall called it the best episode of disappointing season
he was mainly positive towards the focus of the episode with both story lines in tallahassee and scranton taken place after hours and for the several plot lines in the episode
he praised the pairing of darryl and val saying that they are better matched to be the series new jim and pam than andy and erin
cindy white of ign said that the episode proved the series was on hot streak
she mainly liked the storylines taking place in tallahassee and said that the end of the dwight nellie storyline was nice bit of character development
she was also very positive to baumgarter directing in the episode saying he nailed the documentary format of the episode
she went on to slightly criticize the scranton storyline and wrote that she hoped the writers would wait before putting val and darryl together
she ultimately gave the episode not all reviews were positive
club reviewer myles mcnutt wrote that the episode was too crowded and that while all four plotlines had potential they weren given enough time to develop
despite this he did compliment the dwight scenes due to their ability to gain comic rhythm
he also complimented the dwight nellie todd storyline saying that his decision to not sleep with nellie was nicely human moment and also wrote that the character was more grounded when he was more self aware
he ultimately gave the episode many critics commented on the plot featuring cathy attempting to seduce jim
white noted that jim did bumble it bit in the face of cathy taking insincere offense at his accusation but the outcome wasn hard to predict
of course jim would stay true to his real soulmate
sepinwall noted dwight cartoonish behavior in the episode although he called it good addition to the jim cathy story line
mcnutt wrote that due to the choppy storytelling the jim cathy storyline was not able to feel awkward enough to feel jim struggle

in mathematics spectral theory is an inclusive term for theories extending the eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of single square matrix to much broader theory of the structure of operators in variety of mathematical spaces
it is result of studies of linear algebra and the solutions of systems of linear equations and their generalizations
the theory is connected to that of analytic functions because the spectral properties of an operator are related to analytic functions of the spectral parameter
mathematical background the name spectral theory was introduced by david hilbert in his original formulation of hilbert space theory which was cast in terms of quadratic forms in infinitely many variables
the original spectral theorem was therefore conceived as version of the theorem on principal axes of an ellipsoid in an infinite dimensional setting
the later discovery in quantum mechanics that spectral theory could explain features of atomic spectra was therefore fortuitous
hilbert himself was surprised by the unexpected application of this theory noting that developed my theory of infinitely many variables from purely mathematical interests and even called it spectral analysis without any presentiment that it would later find application to the actual spectrum of physics
there have been three main ways to formulate spectral theory each of which find use in different domains
after hilbert initial formulation the later development of abstract hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of single normal operators on them were well suited to the requirements of physics exemplified by the work of von neumann
the further theory built on this to address banach algebras in general
this development leads to the gelfand representation which covers the commutative case and further into non commutative harmonic analysis
the difference can be seen in making the connection with fourier analysis
the fourier transform on the real line is in one sense the spectral theory of differentiation qua differential operator
but for that to cover the phenomena one has already to deal with generalized eigenfunctions for example by means of rigged hilbert space
on the other hand it is simple to construct group algebra the spectrum of which captures the fourier transform basic properties and this is carried out by means of pontryagin duality
one can also study the spectral properties of operators on banach spaces
for example compact operators on banach spaces have many spectral properties similar to that of matrices
physical background the background in the physics of vibrations has been explained in this way spectral theory is connected with the investigation of localized vibrations of variety of different objects from atoms and molecules in chemistry to obstacles in acoustic waveguides
these vibrations have frequencies and the issue is to decide when such localized vibrations occur and how to go about computing the frequencies
this is very complicated problem since every object has not only fundamental tone but also complicated series of overtones which vary radically from one body to another
such physical ideas have nothing to do with the mathematical theory on technical level but there are examples of indirect involvement see for example mark kac question can you hear the shape of drum
hilbert adoption of the term spectrum has been attributed to an paper of wilhelm wirtinger on hill differential equation by jean dieudonn and it was taken up by his students during the first decade of the twentieth century among them erhard schmidt and hermann weyl
the conceptual basis for hilbert space was developed from hilbert ideas by erhard schmidt and frigyes riesz
it was almost twenty years later when quantum mechanics was formulated in terms of the schr dinger equation that the connection was made to atomic spectra connection with the mathematical physics of vibration had been suspected before as remarked by henri poincar but rejected for simple quantitative reasons absent an explanation of the balmer series
the later discovery in quantum mechanics that spectral theory could explain features of atomic spectra was therefore fortuitous rather than being an object of hilbert spectral theory
definition of spectrum consider bounded linear transformation defined everywhere over general banach space
we form the transformation here is the identity operator and is complex number
the inverse of an operator that is is defined by if the inverse exists is called regular
if it does not exist is called singular
with these definitions the resolvent set of is the set of all complex numbers such that exists and is bounded
this set often is denoted as
the spectrum of is the set of all complex numbers such that fails to exist or is unbounded
often the spectrum of is denoted by
the function for all in that is wherever exists as bounded operator is called the resolvent of the spectrum of is therefore the complement of the resolvent set of in the complex plane
every eigenvalue of belongs to but may contain non eigenvalues this definition applies to banach space but of course other types of space exist as well for example topological vector spaces include banach spaces but can be more general
on the other hand banach spaces include hilbert spaces and it is these spaces that find the greatest application and the richest theoretical results
with suitable restrictions much can be said about the structure of the spectra of transformations in hilbert space
in particular for self adjoint operators the spectrum lies on the real line and in general is spectral combination of point spectrum of discrete eigenvalues and continuous spectrum
spectral theory briefly in functional analysis and linear algebra the spectral theorem establishes conditions under which an operator can be expressed in simple form as sum of simpler operators
as full rigorous presentation is not appropriate for this article we take an approach that avoids much of the rigor and satisfaction of formal treatment with the aim of being more comprehensible to non specialist
this topic is easiest to describe by introducing the bra ket notation of dirac for operators
as an example very particular linear operator might be written as dyadic product in terms of the bra and the ket
function is described by ket as
the function defined on the coordinates is denoted as and the magnitude of by where the notation denotes complex conjugate
this inner product choice defines very specific inner product space restricting the generality of the arguments that follow the effect of upon function is then described as expressing the result that the effect of on is to produce new function multiplied by the inner product represented by
more general linear operator might be expressed as where the are scalars and the are basis and the reciprocal basis for the space
the relation between the basis and the reciprocal basis is described in part by if such formalism applies the are eigenvalues of and the functions are eigenfunctions of the eigenvalues are in the spectrum of some natural questions are under what circumstances does this formalism work and for what operators are expansions in series of other operators like this possible
can any function be expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions are they schauder basis and under what circumstances does point spectrum or continuous spectrum arise
how do the formalisms for infinite dimensional spaces and finite dimensional spaces differ or do they differ
can these ideas be extended to broader class of spaces
answering such questions is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra
resolution of the identity this section continues in the rough and ready manner of the above section using the bra ket notation and glossing over the many important details of rigorous treatment
rigorous mathematical treatment may be found in various references
in particular the dimension of the space will be finite
using the bra ket notation of the above section the identity operator may be written as where it is supposed as above that are basis and the reciprocal basis for the space satisfying the relation this expression of the identity operation is called representation or resolution of the identity
this formal representation satisfies the basic property of the identity valid for every positive integer applying the resolution of the identity to any function in the space one obtains which is the generalized fourier expansion of in terms of the basis functions
given some operator equation of the form with in the space this equation can be solved in the above basis through the formal manipulations which converts the operator equation to matrix equation determining the unknown coefficients cj in terms of the generalized fourier coefficients of and the matrix elements of the operator the role of spectral theory arises in establishing the nature and existence of the basis and the reciprocal basis
in particular the basis might consist of the eigenfunctions of some linear operator with the the eigenvalues of from the spectrum of then the resolution of the identity above provides the dyad expansion of
resolvent operator using spectral theory the resolvent operator can be evaluated in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of and the green function corresponding to can be found
applying to some arbitrary function in the space say
this function has poles in the complex plane at each eigenvalue of thus using the calculus of residues where the line integral is over contour that includes all the eigenvalues of suppose our functions are defined over some coordinates that is
introducing the notation where is the dirac delta function we can write then the function defined by is called the green function for operator and satisfies
operator equations consider the operator equation in terms of coordinates
particular case is the green function of the previous section is and satisfies

in quantum chemistry electron valence state perturbation theory nevpt is perturbative treatment applicable to multireference casci type wavefunctions
it can be considered as generalization of the well known second order ller plesset perturbation theory to multireference complete active space cases
the theory is directly integrated into many quantum chemistry packages such as molcas molpro dalton pyscf and orca
the research performed into the development of this theory led to various implementations
the theory here presented refers to the deployment for the single state nevpt where the perturbative correction is applied to single electronic state
research implementations has been also developed for quasi degenerate cases where set of electronic states undergo the perturbative correction at the same time allowing interaction among themselves
the theory development makes use of the quasi degenerate formalism by lindgren and the hamiltonian multipartitioning technique from zaitsevskii and malrieu
theory let be zero order casci wavefunction defined as linear combination of slater determinants obtained diagonalizing the true hamiltonian inside the casci space where is the projector inside the casci space
it is possible to define perturber wavefunctions in nevpt as zero order wavefunctions of the outer space external to cas where electrons are removed from the inactive part core and virtual orbitals and added to the valence part active orbitals
at second order of perturbation decomposing the zero order casci wavefunction as an antisymmetrized product of the inactive part and valence part then the perturber wavefunctions can be written as the pattern of inactive orbitals involved in the procedure can be grouped as collective index so to represent the various perturber wavefunctions as with an enumerator index for the different wavefunctions
the number of these functions is relative to the degree of contraction of the resulting perturbative space
supposing indexes and referring to core orbitals and referring to active orbitals and and referring to virtual orbitals the possible excitation schemes are two electrons from core orbitals to virtual orbitals the active space is not enriched nor depleted of electrons therefore one electron from core orbital to virtual orbital and one electron from core orbital to an active orbital the active space is enriched with one electron therefore one electron from core orbital to virtual orbital and one electron from an active orbital to virtual orbital the active space is depleted with one electron therefore two electrons from core orbitals to active orbitals active space enriched with two electrons two electrons from active orbitals to virtual orbitals active space depleted with two electrons these cases always represent situations where interclass electronic excitations happen
other three excitation schemes involve single interclass excitation plus an intraclass excitation internal to the active space one electron from core orbital to virtual orbital and an internal active active excitation one electron from core orbital to an active orbital and an internal active active excitation one electron from an active orbital to virtual orbital and an internal active active excitation totally uncontracted approach possible approach is to define the perturber wavefunctions into hilbert spaces defined by those determinants with given and labels
the determinants characterizing these spaces can be written as partition comprising the same inactive core virtual part and all possible valence active parts the full dimensionality of these spaces can be exploited to obtain the definition of the perturbers by diagonalizing the hamiltonian inside them this procedure is impractical given its high computational cost for each space diagonalization of the true hamiltonian must be performed
computationally is preferable to improve the theoretical development making use of the modified dyall hamiltonian this hamiltonian behaves like the true hamiltonian inside the cas space having the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the true hamiltonian projected onto the cas space
also given the decomposition for the wavefunction defined before the action of the dyall hamiltonian can be partitioned into stripping out the constant contribution of the inactive part and leaving subsystem to be solved for the valence part the total energy is the sum of and the energies of the orbitals involved in the definition of the inactive part this introduces the possibility to perform single diagonalization of the valence dyall hamiltonian on the casci zero order wavefunction and evaluate the perturber energies using the property depicted above
strongly contracted approach different choice in the development of the nevpt approach is to choose single function for each space leading to the strongly contracted sc scheme
set of perturbative operators are used to produce single function for each space defined as the projection inside each space of the application of the hamiltonian to the contracted zero order wavefunction
in other words where is the projector onto the subspace
this can be equivalently written as the application of specific part of the hamiltonian to the zero order wavefunction for each space appropriate operators can be devised
we will not present their definition as it could result overkilling
suffice to say that the resulting perturbers are not normalized and their norm plays an important role in the strongly contracted development
to evaluate these norms the spinless density matrix of rank not higher than three between the functions are needed
an important property of the is that any other function of the space which is orthogonal to do not interact with the zero order wavefunction through the true hamiltonian
it is possible to use the functions as basis set for the expansion of the first order correction to the wavefunction and also for the expression of the zero order hamiltonian by means of spectral decomposition where are the normalized
the expression for the first order correction to the wavefunction is therefore and for the energy is this result still misses definition of the perturber energies which can be defined in computationally advantageous approach by means of the dyall hamiltonian leading to developing the first term and extracting the inactive part of the dyall hamiltonian it can be obtained with equal to the sum of the orbital energies of the newly occupied virtual orbitals minus the orbital energies of the unoccupied core orbitals
the term that still needs to be evaluated is the bracket involving the commutator
this can be obtained developing each operator and substituting
to obtain the final result it is necessary to evaluate koopmans matrices and density matrices involving only active indexes
an interesting case is represented by the contribution for the case which is trivial and can be demonstrated identical to the ller plesset second order contribution nevpt can therefore be seen as generalized form of mp to multireference wavefunctions
partially contracted approach an alternative approach named partially contracted pc is to define the perturber wavefunctions in subspace of with dimensionality higher than one like in case of the strongly contracted approach
to define this subspace set of functions is generated by means of the operators after decontraction of their formulation
for example in the case of the operator the partially contracted approach makes use of functions and
these functions must be orthonormalized and purged of linear dependencies which may arise
the resulting set spans the space
once all the spaces have been defined we can obtain as usual set of perturbers from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian true or dyall inside this space as usual the evaluation of the partially contracted perturbative correction by means of the dyall hamiltonian involves simply manageable entities for nowadays computers
although the strongly contracted approach makes use of perturbative space with very low flexibility in general it provides values in very good agreement with those obtained by the more decontracted space defined for the partially contracted approach
this can be probably explained by the fact that the strongly contracted perturbers are good average of the totally decontracted perturbative space
the partially contracted evaluation has very little overhead in computational cost with respect to the strongly contracted one therefore they are normally evaluated together
properties nevpt is blessed with many important properties making the approach very solid and reliable
these properties arise both from the theoretical approach used and on the dyall hamiltonian particular structure size consistency nevpt is size consistent strict separable
briefly if and are two non interacting systems the energy of the supersystem is equal to the sum of the energy of plus the energy of taken by themselves
this property is of particular importance to obtain correctly behaving dissociation curves
absence of intruder states in perturbation theory divergencies can occur if the energy of some perturber happens to be nearly equal to the energy of the zero order wavefunction
this situation which is due to the presence of an energy difference at the denominator can be avoided if the energies associated to the perturbers are guaranteed to be never nearly equal to the zero order energy
nevpt satisfies this requirement
invariance under active orbital rotation the nevpt results are stable if an intraclass active active orbital mixing occurs
this arises both from the structure of the dyall hamiltonian and the properties of casscf wavefunction
this property has been also extended to the intraclass core core and virtual virtual mixing thanks to the non canonical nevpt approach allowing to apply nevpt evaluation without performing an orbital canonization which is required as we saw previously spin purity is guaranteed the resulting wave functions are guaranteed to be spin pure due to the spin free formalism
efficiency although not formal theoretical property computational efficiency is highly important for the evaluation on medium size molecular systems
the current limit of the nevpt application is largely dependent on the feasibility of the previous casscf evaluation which scales factorially with respect to the active space size
the nevpt implementation using the dyall hamiltonian involves the evaluation of koopmans matrices and density matrices up to the four particle density matrix spanning only active orbitals
this is particularly convenient given the small size of currently used active spaces
partitioning into additive classes the perturbative correction to the energy is additive on eight different contributions
although the evaluation of each contribution has different computational cost this fact can be used to improve performance by parallelizing each contribution to different processor

in probability theory and statistics variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of random variable from its population mean or sample mean
variance is measure of dispersion meaning it is measure of how far set of numbers is spread out from their average value
variance has central role in statistics where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics statistical inference hypothesis testing goodness of fit and monte carlo sampling
variance is an important tool in the sciences where statistical analysis of data is common
the variance is the square of the standard deviation the second central moment of distribution and the covariance of the random variable with itself and it is often represented by var or an advantage of variance as measure of dispersion is that it is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than other measures of dispersion such as the expected absolute deviation for example the variance of sum of uncorrelated random variables is equal to the sum of their variances
disadvantage of the variance for practical applications is that unlike the standard deviation its units differ from the random variable which is why the standard deviation is more commonly reported as measure of dispersion once the calculation is finished
there are two distinct concepts that are both called variance
one as discussed above is part of theoretical probability distribution and is defined by an equation
the other variance is characteristic of set of observations
when variance is calculated from observations those observations are typically measured from real world system
if all possible observations of the system are present then the calculated variance is called the population variance
normally however only subset is available and the variance calculated from this is called the sample variance
the variance calculated from sample is considered an estimate of the full population variance
there are multiple ways to calculate an estimate of the population variance as discussed in the section below
the two kinds of variance are closely related
to see how consider that theoretical probability distribution can be used as generator of hypothetical observations
if an infinite number of observations are generated using distribution then the sample variance calculated from that infinite set will match the value calculated using the distribution equation for variance
etymology the term variance was first introduced by ronald fisher in his paper the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance the great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of human measurement from its mean follow very closely the normal law of errors and therefore that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error
when there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations and it is found that the distribution when both causes act together has standard deviation it is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability
we shall term this quantity the variance definition the variance of random variable is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of var
this definition encompasses random variables that are generated by processes that are discrete continuous neither or mixed
the variance can also be thought of as the covariance of random variable with itself var cov
the variance is also equivalent to the second cumulant of probability distribution that generates the variance is typically designated as var or sometimes as or or symbolically as or simply pronounced sigma squared
the expression for the variance can be expanded as follows var in other words the variance of is equal to the mean of the square of minus the square of the mean of this equation should not be used for computations using floating point arithmetic because it suffers from catastrophic cancellation if the two components of the equation are similar in magnitude
for other numerically stable alternatives see algorithms for calculating variance
discrete random variable if the generator of random variable is discrete with probability mass function then var where is the expected value
when such discrete weighted variance is specified by weights whose sum is not then one divides by the sum of the weights
the variance of collection of equally likely values can be written as var where is the average value
that is the variance of set of equally likely values can be equivalently expressed without directly referring to the mean in terms of squared deviations of all pairwise squared distances of points from each other var
absolutely continuous random variable if the random variable has probability density function and is the corresponding cumulative distribution function then var or equivalently var where is the expected value of given by
in these formulas the integrals with respect to and are lebesgue and lebesgue stieltjes integrals respectively
if the function is riemann integrable on every finite interval then var where the integral is an improper riemann integral
examples exponential distribution the exponential distribution with parameter is continuous distribution whose probability density function is given by on the interval
its mean can be shown to be using integration by parts and making use of the expected value already calculated we have thus the variance of is given by var
fair die fair six sided die can be modeled as discrete random variable with outcomes through each with equal probability
the expected value of is therefore the variance of is var the general formula for the variance of the outcome of an sided die is var
commonly used probability distributions the following table lists the variance for some commonly used probability distributions
properties basic properties variance is non negative because the squares are positive or zero var the variance of constant is zero
var conversely if the variance of random variable is then it is almost surely constant
that is it always has the same value var
issues of finiteness if distribution does not have finite expected value as is the case for the cauchy distribution then the variance cannot be finite either
however some distributions may not have finite variance despite their expected value being finite
an example is pareto distribution whose index satisfies
decomposition the general formula for variance decomposition or the law of total variance is if and are two random variables and the variance of exists then var var var
the conditional expectation of given and the conditional variance var may be understood as follows
given any particular value of the random variable there is conditional expectation given the event this quantity depends on the particular value it is function
that same function evaluated at the random variable is the conditional expectation
in particular if is discrete random variable assuming possible values with corresponding probabilities then in the formula for total variance the first term on the right hand side becomes var where var
similarly the second term on the right hand side becomes var where and thus the total variance is given by var
similar formula is applied in analysis of variance where the corresponding formula is total between within here refers to the mean of the squares
in linear regression analysis the corresponding formula is total regression residual
this can also be derived from the additivity of variances since the total observed score is the sum of the predicted score and the error score where the latter two are uncorrelated
similar decompositions are possible for the sum of squared deviations sum of squares total between within total regression residual
calculation from the cdf the population variance for non negative random variable can be expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function using this expression can be used to calculate the variance in situations where the cdf but not the density can be conveniently expressed
characteristic property the second moment of random variable attains the minimum value when taken around the first moment mean of the random variable
conversely if continuous function satisfies for all random variables then it is necessarily of the form where this also holds in the multidimensional case
units of measurement unlike the expected absolute deviation the variance of variable has units that are the square of the units of the variable itself
for example variable measured in meters will have variance measured in meters squared
for this reason describing data sets via their standard deviation or root mean square deviation is often preferred over using the variance
in the dice example the standard deviation is slightly larger than the expected absolute deviation of the standard deviation and the expected absolute deviation can both be used as an indicator of the spread of distribution
the standard deviation is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than the expected absolute deviation and together with variance and its generalization covariance is used frequently in theoretical statistics however the expected absolute deviation tends to be more robust as it is less sensitive to outliers arising from measurement anomalies or an unduly heavy tailed distribution
propagation addition and multiplication by constant variance is invariant with respect to changes in location parameter
that is if constant is added to all values of the variable the variance is unchanged var var
if all values are scaled by constant the variance is scaled by the square of that constant var var
the variance of sum of two random variables is given by var var var cov var var var cov where cov is the covariance
linear combinations in general for the sum of random variables the variance becomes var cov var cov see also general bienaym identity
these results lead to the variance of linear combination as var cov var cov var cov
if the random variables are such that cov then they are said to be uncorrelated
it follows immediately from the expression given earlier that if the random variables are uncorrelated then the variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their variances or expressed symbolically var var
since independent random variables are always uncorrelated see covariance uncorrelatedness and independence the equation above holds in particular when the random variables are independent
thus independence is sufficient but not necessary for the variance of the sum to equal the sum of the variances
matrix notation for the variance of linear combination define as column vector of random variables and as column vector of scalars therefore is linear combination of these random variables where denotes the transpose of also let be the covariance matrix of the variance of is then given by var this implies that the variance of the mean can be written as with column vector of ones var var
sum of variables sum of uncorrelated variables one reason for the use of the variance in preference to other measures of dispersion is that the variance of the sum or the difference of uncorrelated random variables is the sum of their variances var var
this statement is called the bienaym formula and was discovered in it is often made with the stronger condition that the variables are independent but being uncorrelated suffices
so if all the variables have the same variance then since division by is linear transformation this formula immediately implies that the variance of their mean is var var var that is the variance of the mean decreases when increases
this formula for the variance of the mean is used in the definition of the standard error of the sample mean which is used in the central limit theorem
to prove the initial statement it suffices to show that var var var
the general result then follows by induction
starting with the definition var using the linearity of the expectation operator and the assumption of independence or uncorrelatedness of and this further simplifies as follows var var var
sum of correlated variables sum of correlated variables with fixed sample size in general the variance of the sum of variables is the sum of their covariances var cov var cov
note the second equality comes from the fact that cov xi xi var xi
here cov is the covariance which is zero for independent random variables if it exists
the formula states that the variance of sum is equal to the sum of all elements in the covariance matrix of the components
the next expression states equivalently that the variance of the sum is the sum of the diagonal of covariance matrix plus two times the sum of its upper triangular elements or its lower triangular elements this emphasizes that the covariance matrix is symmetric
this formula is used in the theory of cronbach alpha in classical test theory
so if the variables have equal variance and the average correlation of distinct variables is then the variance of their mean is var this implies that the variance of the mean increases with the average of the correlations
in other words additional correlated observations are not as effective as additional independent observations at reducing the uncertainty of the mean
moreover if the variables have unit variance for example if they are standardized then this simplifies to var this formula is used in the spearman brown prediction formula of classical test theory
this converges to if goes to infinity provided that the average correlation remains constant or converges too
so for the variance of the mean of standardized variables with equal correlations or converging average correlation we have lim var therefore the variance of the mean of large number of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation
this makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the population mean even though the law of large numbers states that the sample mean will converge for independent variables
sum of uncorrelated variables with random sample size there are cases when sample is taken without knowing in advance how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion
in such cases the sample size is random variable whose variation adds to the variation of such that var var var which follows from the law of total variance
if has poisson distribution then var with estimator so the estimator of var becomes giving se weighted sum of variables the scaling property and the bienaym formula along with the property of the covariance cov ax by ab cov jointly imply that var var var cov
this implies that in weighted sum of variables the variable with the largest weight will have disproportionally large weight in the variance of the total
for example if and are uncorrelated and the weight of is two times the weight of then the weight of the variance of will be four times the weight of the variance of the expression above can be extended to weighted sum of multiple variables var var cov product of variables product of independent variables if two variables and are independent the variance of their product is given by var var var var var
equivalently using the basic properties of expectation it is given by var
product of statistically dependent variables in general if two variables are statistically dependent then the variance of their product is given by var cov cov var var cov arbitrary functions the delta method uses second order taylor expansions to approximate the variance of function of one or more random variables see taylor expansions for the moments of functions of random variables
for example the approximate variance of function of one variable is given by var var provided that is twice differentiable and that the mean and variance of are finite
population variance and sample variance real world observations such as the measurements of yesterday rain throughout the day typically cannot be complete sets of all possible observations that could be made
as such the variance calculated from the finite set will in general not match the variance that would have been calculated from the full population of possible observations
this means that one estimates the mean and variance from limited set of observations by using an estimator equation
the estimator is function of the sample of observations drawn without observational bias from the whole population of potential observations
in this example that sample would be the set of actual measurements of yesterday rainfall from available rain gauges within the geography of interest
the simplest estimators for population mean and population variance are simply the mean and variance of the sample the sample mean and uncorrected sample variance these are consistent estimators they converge to the correct value as the number of samples increases but can be improved
estimating the population variance by taking the sample variance is close to optimal in general but can be improved in two ways
most simply the sample variance is computed as an average of squared deviations about the sample mean by dividing by however using values other than improves the estimator in various ways
four common values for the denominator are and is the simplest population variance of the sample eliminates bias minimizes mean squared error for the normal distribution and mostly eliminates bias in unbiased estimation of standard deviation for the normal distribution
firstly if the true population mean is unknown then the sample variance which uses the sample mean in place of the true mean is biased estimator it underestimates the variance by factor of correcting by this factor dividing by instead of is called bessel correction
the resulting estimator is unbiased and is called the corrected sample variance or unbiased sample variance
for example when the variance of single observation about the sample mean itself is obviously zero regardless of the population variance
if the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the variance then this bias does not arise and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the independently known mean
secondly the sample variance does not generally minimize mean squared error between sample variance and population variance
correcting for bias often makes this worse one can always choose scale factor that performs better than the corrected sample variance though the optimal scale factor depends on the excess kurtosis of the population see mean squared error variance and introduces bias
this always consists of scaling down the unbiased estimator dividing by number larger than and is simple example of shrinkage estimator one shrinks the unbiased estimator towards zero
for the normal distribution dividing by instead of or minimizes mean squared error
the resulting estimator is biased however and is known as the biased sample variation
population variance in general the population variance of finite population of size with values xi is given by where the population mean is the population variance can also be computed using this is true because the population variance matches the variance of the generating probability distribution
in this sense the concept of population can be extended to continuous random variables with infinite populations
sample variance biased sample variance in many practical situations the true variance of population is not known priori and must be computed somehow
when dealing with extremely large populations it is not possible to count every object in the population so the computation must be performed on sample of the population
sample variance can also be applied to the estimation of the variance of continuous distribution from sample of that distribution
we take sample with replacement of values yn from the population where and estimate the variance on the basis of this sample
directly taking the variance of the sample data gives the average of the squared deviations here denotes the sample mean since the yi are selected randomly both and are random variables
their expected values can be evaluated by averaging over the ensemble of all possible samples of size from the population
for this gives hence gives an estimate of the population variance that is biased by factor of for this reason is referred to as the biased sample variance
unbiased sample variance correcting for this bias yields the unbiased sample variance denoted either estimator may be simply referred to as the sample variance when the version can be determined by context
the same proof is also applicable for samples taken from continuous probability distribution
the use of the term is called bessel correction and it is also used in sample covariance and the sample standard deviation the square root of variance
the square root is concave function and thus introduces negative bias by jensen inequality which depends on the distribution and thus the corrected sample standard deviation using bessel correction is biased
the unbiased estimation of standard deviation is technically involved problem though for the normal distribution using the term yields an almost unbiased estimator
the unbiased sample variance is statistic for the function meaning that it is obtained by averaging sample statistic over element subsets of the population
distribution of the sample variance being function of random variables the sample variance is itself random variable and it is natural to study its distribution
in the case that yi are independent observations from normal distribution cochran theorem shows that follows scaled chi squared distribution see also asymptotic properties as direct consequence it follows that and var var var if the yi are independent and identically distributed but not necessarily normally distributed then var where is the kurtosis of the distribution and is the fourth central moment
if the conditions of the law of large numbers hold for the squared observations is consistent estimator of
one can see indeed that the variance of the estimator tends asymptotically to zero
an asymptotically equivalent formula was given in kenney and keeping rose and smith and weisstein
samuelson inequality samuelson inequality is result that states bounds on the values that individual observations in sample can take given that the sample mean and biased variance have been calculated
values must lie within the limits
relations with the harmonic and arithmetic means it has been shown that for sample of positive real numbers max where ymax is the maximum of the sample is the arithmetic mean is the harmonic mean of the sample and is the biased variance of the sample
this bound has been improved and it is known that variance is bounded by max max max min min min where ymin is the minimum of the sample
tests of equality of variances the test of equality of variances and the chi square tests are adequate when the sample is normally distributed
non normality makes testing for the equality of two or more variances more difficult
several non parametric tests have been proposed these include the barton david ansari freund siegel tukey test the capon test mood test the klotz test and the sukhatme test
the sukhatme test applies to two variances and requires that both medians be known and equal to zero
the mood klotz capon and barton david ansari freund siegel tukey tests also apply to two variances
they allow the median to be unknown but do require that the two medians are equal
the lehmann test is parametric test of two variances
of this test there are several variants known
other tests of the equality of variances include the box test the box anderson test and the moses test
resampling methods which include the bootstrap and the jackknife may be used to test the equality of variances
moment of inertia the variance of probability distribution is analogous to the moment of inertia in classical mechanics of corresponding mass distribution along line with respect to rotation about its center of mass
it is because of this analogy that such things as the variance are called moments of probability distributions
the covariance matrix is related to the moment of inertia tensor for multivariate distributions
the moment of inertia of cloud of points with covariance matrix of is given by tr
this difference between moment of inertia in physics and in statistics is clear for points that are gathered along line
suppose many points are close to the axis and distributed along it
the covariance matrix might look like
that is there is the most variance in the direction
physicists would consider this to have low moment about the axis so the moment of inertia tensor is
semivariance the semivariance is calculated in the same manner as the variance but only those observations that fall below the mean are included in the calculation it is also described as specific measure in different fields of application
for skewed distributions the semivariance can provide additional information that variance does not for inequalities associated with the semivariance see chebyshev inequality semivariances
generalizations for complex variables if is scalar complex valued random variable with values in then its variance is where is the complex conjugate of this variance is real scalar
for vector valued random variables as matrix if is vector valued random variable with values in and thought of as column vector then natural generalization of variance is where and is the transpose of and so is row vector
the result is positive semi definite square matrix commonly referred to as the variance covariance matrix or simply as the covariance matrix
if is vector and complex valued random variable with values in then the covariance matrix is where is the conjugate transpose of this matrix is also positive semi definite and square
as scalar another generalization of variance for vector valued random variables which results in scalar value rather than in matrix is the generalized variance det the determinant of the covariance matrix
the generalized variance can be shown to be related to the multidimensional scatter of points around their mean different generalization is obtained by considering the euclidean distance between the random variable and its mean
this results in tr which is the trace of the covariance matrix

the sample mean or empirical mean and the sample covariance are statistics computed from sample of data on one or more random variables
the sample mean is the average value or mean value of sample of numbers taken from larger population of numbers where population indicates not number of people but the entirety of relevant data whether collected or not
sample of companies sales from the fortune might be used for convenience instead of looking at the population all companies sales
the sample mean is used as an estimator for the population mean the average value in the entire population where the estimate is more likely to be close to the population mean if the sample is large and representative
the reliability of the sample mean is estimated using the standard error which in turn is calculated using the variance of the sample
if the sample is random the standard error falls with the size of the sample and the sample mean distribution approaches the normal distribution as the sample size increases
the term sample mean can also be used to refer to vector of average values when the statistician is looking at the values of several variables in the sample
the sales profits and employees of sample of fortune companies
in this case there is not just sample variance for each variable but sample variance covariance matrix or simply covariance matrix showing also the relationship between each pair of variables
this would be matrix when variables are being considered
the sample covariance is useful in judging the reliability of the sample means as estimators and is also useful as an estimate of the population covariance matrix
due to their ease of calculation and other desirable characteristics the sample mean and sample covariance are widely used in statistics to represent the location and dispersion of the distribution of values in the sample and to estimate the values for the population
definition of the sample mean the sample mean is the average of the values of variable in sample which is the sum of those values divided by the number of values
using mathematical notation if sample of observations on variable is taken from the population the sample mean is under this definition if the sample is taken from the population then the sample mean is as compared to the population mean of even if sample is random it is rarely perfectly representative and other samples would have other sample means even if the samples were all from the same population
the sample for example would have sample mean of if the statistician is interested in variables rather than one each observation having value for each of those variables the overall sample mean consists of sample means for individual variables
let be the ith independently drawn observation on the jth random variable
these observations can be arranged into column vectors each with entries with the column vector giving the th observations of all variables being denoted
the sample mean vector is column vector whose th element is the average value of the observations of the jth variable thus the sample mean vector contains the average of the observations for each variable and is written definition of sample covariance the sample covariance matrix is by matrix with entries where is an estimate of the covariance between the jth variable and the kth variable of the population underlying the data
in terms of the observation vectors the sample covariance is
alternatively arranging the observation vectors as the columns of matrix so that which is matrix of rows and columns
here the sample covariance matrix can be computed as where is an by vector of ones
if the observations are arranged as rows instead of columns so is now row vector and is an matrix whose column is the vector of observations on variable then applying transposes in the appropriate places yields
like covariance matrices for random vector sample covariance matrices are positive semi definite
to prove it note that for any matrix the matrix is positive semi definite
furthermore covariance matrix is positive definite if and only if the rank of the
vectors is unbiasedness the sample mean and the sample covariance matrix are unbiased estimates of the mean and the covariance matrix of the random vector row vector whose jth element is one of the random variables
the sample covariance matrix has in the denominator rather than due to variant of bessel correction in short the sample covariance relies on the difference between each observation and the sample mean but the sample mean is slightly correlated with each observation since it is defined in terms of all observations
if the population mean is known the analogous unbiased estimate using the population mean has in the denominator
this is an example of why in probability and statistics it is essential to distinguish between random variables upper case letters and realizations of the random variables lower case letters
the maximum likelihood estimate of the covariance for the gaussian distribution case has in the denominator as well
the ratio of to approaches for large so the maximum likelihood estimate approximately equals the unbiased estimate when the sample is large
distribution of the sample mean for each random variable the sample mean is good estimator of the population mean where good estimator is defined as being efficient and unbiased
of course the estimator will likely not be the true value of the population mean since different samples drawn from the same distribution will give different sample means and hence different estimates of the true mean
thus the sample mean is random variable not constant and consequently has its own distribution
for random sample of observations on the jth random variable the sample mean distribution itself has mean equal to the population mean and variance equal to where is the population variance
the arithmetic mean of population or population mean is often denoted the sample mean the arithmetic mean of sample of values drawn from the population makes good estimator of the population mean as its expected value is equal to the population mean that is it is an unbiased estimator
the sample mean is random variable not constant since its calculated value will randomly differ depending on which members of the population are sampled and consequently it will have its own distribution
for random sample of independent observations the expected value of the sample mean is and the variance of the sample mean is var if the samples are not independent but correlated then special care has to be taken in order to avoid the problem of pseudoreplication
if the population is normally distributed then the sample mean is normally distributed as follows
if the population is not normally distributed the sample mean is nonetheless approximately normally distributed if is large and
this is consequence of the central limit theorem
weighted samples in weighted sample each vector each set of single observations on each of the random variables is assigned weight without loss of generality assume that the weights are normalized
if they are not divide the weights by their sum
then the weighted mean vector is given by and the elements of the weighted covariance matrix are
if all weights are the same the weighted mean and covariance reduce to the biased sample mean and covariance mentioned above
criticism the sample mean and sample covariance are not robust statistics meaning that they are sensitive to outliers
as robustness is often desired trait particularly in real world applications robust alternatives may prove desirable notably quantile based statistics such as the sample median for location and interquartile range iqr for dispersion
other alternatives include trimming and winsorising as in the trimmed mean and the winsorized mean

in coding theory parity check matrix of linear block code is matrix which describes the linear relations that the components of codeword must satisfy
it can be used to decide whether particular vector is codeword and is also used in decoding algorithms
definition formally parity check matrix of linear code is generator matrix of the dual code
this means that codeword is in if and only if the matrix vector product hc some authors would write this in an equivalent form ch
the rows of parity check matrix are the coefficients of the parity check equations
that is they show how linear combinations of certain digits components of each codeword equal zero
for example the parity check matrix compactly represents the parity check equations that must be satisfied for the vector to be codeword of from the definition of the parity check matrix it directly follows the minimum distance of the code is the minimum number such that every columns of parity check matrix are linearly independent while there exist columns of that are linearly dependent
creating parity check matrix the parity check matrix for given code can be derived from its generator matrix and vice versa
if the generator matrix for an code is in standard form then the parity check matrix is given by because negation is performed in the finite field fq
note that if the characteristic of the underlying field is in that field as in binary codes then so the negation is unnecessary
for example if binary code has the generator matrix then its parity check matrix is it can be verified that is matrix while is matrix
syndromes for any row vector of the ambient vector space hx is called the syndrome of the vector is codeword if and only if the calculation of syndromes is the basis for the syndrome decoding algorithm

introduction to coding theory
in the mathematical discipline of linear algebra matrix decomposition or matrix factorization is factorization of matrix into product of matrices
there are many different matrix decompositions each finds use among particular class of problems
example in numerical analysis different decompositions are used to implement efficient matrix algorithms
for instance when solving system of linear equations the matrix can be decomposed via the lu decomposition
the lu decomposition factorizes matrix into lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix the systems and require fewer additions and multiplications to solve compared with the original system though one might require significantly more digits in inexact arithmetic such as floating point
similarly the qr decomposition expresses as qr with an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix
the system rx is solved by rx qtb and the system rx is solved by back substitution
the number of additions and multiplications required is about twice that of using the lu solver but no more digits are required in inexact arithmetic because the qr decomposition is numerically stable
decompositions related to solving systems of linear equations lu decomposition traditionally applicable to square matrix although rectangular matrices can be applicable
decomposition where is lower triangular and is upper triangular related the ldu decomposition is where is lower triangular with ones on the diagonal is upper triangular with ones on the diagonal and is diagonal matrix
related the lup decomposition is where is lower triangular is upper triangular and is permutation matrix
existence an lup decomposition exists for any square matrix when is an identity matrix the lup decomposition reduces to the lu decomposition
comments the lup and lu decompositions are useful in solving an by system of linear equations these decompositions summarize the process of gaussian elimination in matrix form
matrix represents any row interchanges carried out in the process of gaussian elimination
if gaussian elimination produces the row echelon form without requiring any row interchanges then so an lu decomposition exists
lu reduction block lu decomposition rank factorization applicable to by matrix of rank decomposition where is an by full column rank matrix and is an by full row rank matrix comment the rank factorization can be used to compute the moore penrose pseudoinverse of which one can apply to obtain all solutions of the linear system
cholesky decomposition applicable to square hermitian positive definite matrix decomposition where is upper triangular with real positive diagonal entries comment if the matrix is hermitian and positive semi definite then it has decomposition of the form if the diagonal entries of are allowed to be zero uniqueness for positive definite matrices cholesky decomposition is unique
however it is not unique in the positive semi definite case
comment if is real and symmetric has all real elements comment an alternative is the ldl decomposition which can avoid extracting square roots
qr decomposition applicable to by matrix with linearly independent columns decomposition where is unitary matrix of size by and is an upper triangular matrix of size by uniqueness in general it is not unique but if is of full rank then there exists single that has all positive diagonal elements
if is square also is unique
comment the qr decomposition provides an effective way to solve the system of equations the fact that is orthogonal means that so that is equivalent to which is very easy to solve since is triangular
rrqr factorization interpolative decomposition decompositions based on eigenvalues and related concepts eigendecomposition also called spectral decomposition
applicable to square matrix with linearly independent eigenvectors not necessarily distinct eigenvalues
decomposition where is diagonal matrix formed from the eigenvalues of and the columns of are the corresponding eigenvectors of existence an by matrix always has complex eigenvalues which can be ordered in more than one way to form an by diagonal matrix and corresponding matrix of nonzero columns that satisfies the eigenvalue equation is invertible if and only if the eigenvectors are linearly independent each eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity equal to its algebraic multiplicity
sufficient but not necessary condition for this to happen is that all the eigenvalues are different in this case geometric and algebraic multiplicity are equal to comment one can always normalize the eigenvectors to have length one see the definition of the eigenvalue equation comment every normal matrix matrix for which where is conjugate transpose can be eigendecomposed
for normal matrix and only for normal matrix the eigenvectors can also be made orthonormal and the eigendecomposition reads as
in particular all unitary hermitian or skew hermitian in the real valued case all orthogonal symmetric or skew symmetric respectively matrices are normal and therefore possess this property
comment for any real symmetric matrix the eigendecomposition always exists and can be written as where both and are real valued
comment the eigendecomposition is useful for understanding the solution of system of linear ordinary differential equations or linear difference equations
for example the difference equation starting from the initial condition is solved by which is equivalent to where and are the matrices formed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of since is diagonal raising it to power just involves raising each element on the diagonal to the power this is much easier to do and understand than raising to power since is usually not diagonal
jordan decomposition the jordan normal form and the jordan chevalley decomposition applicable to square matrix comment the jordan normal form generalizes the eigendecomposition to cases where there are repeated eigenvalues and cannot be diagonalized the jordan chevalley decomposition does this without choosing basis
schur decomposition applicable to square matrix decomposition complex version where is unitary matrix is the conjugate transpose of and is an upper triangular matrix called the complex schur form which has the eigenvalues of along its diagonal
comment if is normal matrix then is diagonal and the schur decomposition coincides with the spectral decomposition
real schur decomposition applicable to square matrix decomposition this is version of schur decomposition where and only contain real numbers
one can always write where is real orthogonal matrix is the transpose of and is block upper triangular matrix called the real schur form
the blocks on the diagonal of are of size in which case they represent real eigenvalues or in which case they are derived from complex conjugate eigenvalue pairs
qz decomposition also called generalized schur decomposition applicable to square matrices and comment there are two versions of this decomposition complex and real
decomposition complex version and where and are unitary matrices the superscript represents conjugate transpose and and are upper triangular matrices
comment in the complex qz decomposition the ratios of the diagonal elements of to the corresponding diagonal elements of are the generalized eigenvalues that solve the generalized eigenvalue problem where is an unknown scalar and is an unknown nonzero vector
decomposition real version and where and are matrices containing real numbers only
in this case and are orthogonal matrices the superscript represents transposition and and are block upper triangular matrices
the blocks on the diagonal of and are of size or
takagi factorization applicable to square complex symmetric matrix decomposition where is real nonnegative diagonal matrix and is unitary
denotes the matrix transpose of comment the diagonal elements of are the nonnegative square roots of the eigenvalues of
comment may be complex even if is real
comment this is not special case of the eigendecomposition see above which uses instead of moreover if is not real it is not hermitian and the form using also does not apply
singular value decomposition applicable to by matrix decomposition where is nonnegative diagonal matrix and and satisfy here is the conjugate transpose of or simply the transpose if contains real numbers only and denotes the identity matrix of some dimension
comment the diagonal elements of are called the singular values of comment like the eigendecomposition above the singular value decomposition involves finding basis directions along which matrix multiplication is equivalent to scalar multiplication but it has greater generality since the matrix under consideration need not be square
uniqueness the singular values of are always uniquely determined
and need not to be unique in general
scale invariant decompositions refers to variants of existing matrix decompositions such as the svd that are invariant with respect to diagonal scaling
applicable to by matrix unit scale invariant singular value decomposition where is unique nonnegative diagonal matrix of scale invariant singular values and are unitary matrices is the conjugate transpose of and positive diagonal matrices and comment is analogous to the svd except that the diagonal elements of are invariant with respect to left and or right multiplication of by arbitrary nonsingular diagonal matrices as opposed to the standard svd for which the singular values are invariant with respect to left and or right multiplication of by arbitrary unitary matrices
comment is an alternative to the standard svd when invariance is required with respect to diagonal rather than unitary transformations of uniqueness the scale invariant singular values of given by the diagonal elements of are always uniquely determined
diagonal matrices and and unitary and are not necessarily unique in general
comment and matrices are not the same as those from the svd analogous scale invariant decompositions can be derived from other matrix decompositions to obtain scale invariant eigenvalues
other decompositions polar decomposition applicable to any square complex matrix decomposition right polar decomposition or left polar decomposition where is unitary matrix and and are positive semidefinite hermitian matrices
uniqueness is always unique and equal to which is always hermitian and positive semidefinite
if is invertible then is unique
comment since any hermitian matrix admits spectral decomposition with unitary matrix can be written as
since is positive semidefinite all elements in are non negative
since the product of two unitary matrices is unitary taking one can write which is the singular value decomposition
hence the existence of the polar decomposition is equivalent to the existence of the singular value decomposition
algebraic polar decomposition applicable to square complex non singular matrix decomposition where is complex orthogonal matrix and is complex symmetric matrix
uniqueness if has no negative real eigenvalues then the decomposition is unique
comment the existence of this decomposition is equivalent to being similar to comment variant of this decomposition is where is real matrix and is circular matrix
mostow decomposition applicable to square complex non singular matrix decomposition where is unitary is real anti symmetric and is real symmetric
comment the matrix can also be decomposed as where is unitary is real anti symmetric and is real symmetric
sinkhorn normal form applicable to square real matrix with strictly positive elements
decomposition where is doubly stochastic and and are real diagonal matrices with strictly positive elements
sectoral decomposition applicable to square complex matrix with numerical range contained in the sector
decomposition where is an invertible complex matrix and diag with all
williamson normal form applicable to square positive definite real matrix with order
decomposition diag where sp is symplectic matrix and is nonnegative by diagonal matrix
matrix square root decomposition not unique in general
in the case of positive semidefinite there is unique positive semidefinite such that
generalizations there exist analogues of the svd qr lu and cholesky factorizations for quasimatrices and cmatrices or continuous matrices
quasimatrix is like matrix rectangular scheme whose elements are indexed but one discrete index is replaced by continuous index
likewise cmatrix is continuous in both indices
as an example of cmatrix one can think of the kernel of an integral operator
these factorizations are based on early work by fredholm hilbert and schmidt

in linear algebra the rank of matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated or spanned by its columns
this corresponds to the maximal number of linearly independent columns of this in turn is identical to the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows
rank is thus measure of the nondegenerateness of the system of linear equations and linear transformation encoded by there are multiple equivalent definitions of rank
matrix rank is one of its most fundamental characteristics
the rank is commonly denoted by rank or rk sometimes the parentheses are not written as in rank
main definitions in this section we give some definitions of the rank of matrix
many definitions are possible see alternative definitions for several of these
the column rank of is the dimension of the column space of while the row rank of is the dimension of the row space of fundamental result in linear algebra is that the column rank and the row rank are always equal
two proofs of this result are given in proofs that column rank row rank below
this number the number of linearly independent rows or columns is simply called the rank of matrix is said to have full rank if its rank equals the largest possible for matrix of the same dimensions which is the lesser of the number of rows and columns
matrix is said to be rank deficient if it does not have full rank
the rank deficiency of matrix is the difference between the lesser of the number of rows and columns and the rank
the rank of linear map or operator is defined as the dimension of its image where dim is the dimension of vector space and img is the image of map
examples the matrix has rank the first two columns are linearly independent so the rank is at least but since the third is linear combination of the first two the first column minus the second the three columns are linearly dependent so the rank must be less than the matrix has rank there are nonzero columns so the rank is positive but any pair of columns is linearly dependent
similarly the transpose of has rank indeed since the column vectors of are the row vectors of the transpose of the statement that the column rank of matrix equals its row rank is equivalent to the statement that the rank of matrix is equal to the rank of its transpose rank rank at
computing the rank of matrix rank from row echelon forms common approach to finding the rank of matrix is to reduce it to simpler form generally row echelon form by elementary row operations
row operations do not change the row space hence do not change the row rank and being invertible map the column space to an isomorphic space hence do not change the column rank
once in row echelon form the rank is clearly the same for both row rank and column rank and equals the number of pivots or basic columns and also the number of non zero rows
for example the matrix given by can be put in reduced row echelon form by using the following elementary row operations the final matrix in row echelon form has two non zero rows and thus the rank of matrix is
computation when applied to floating point computations on computers basic gaussian elimination lu decomposition can be unreliable and rank revealing decomposition should be used instead
an effective alternative is the singular value decomposition svd but there are other less expensive choices such as qr decomposition with pivoting so called rank revealing qr factorization which are still more numerically robust than gaussian elimination
numerical determination of rank requires criterion for deciding when value such as singular value from the svd should be treated as zero practical choice which depends on both the matrix and the application
proofs that column rank row rank proof using row reduction the fact that the column and row ranks of any matrix are equal forms is fundamental in linear algebra
many proofs have been given
one of the most elementary ones has been sketched in rank from row echelon forms
here is variant of this proof it is straightforward to show that neither the row rank nor the column rank are changed by an elementary row operation
as gaussian elimination proceeds by elementary row operations the reduced row echelon form of matrix has the same row rank and the same column rank as the original matrix
further elementary column operations allow putting the matrix in the form of an identity matrix possibly bordered by rows and columns of zeros
again this changes neither the row rank nor the column rank
it is immediate that both the row and column ranks of this resulting matrix is the number of its nonzero entries
we present two other proofs of this result
the first uses only basic properties of linear combinations of vectors and is valid over any field
the proof is based upon wardlaw
the second uses orthogonality and is valid for matrices over the real numbers it is based upon mackiw
both proofs can be found in the book by banerjee and roy
proof using linear combinations let be an matrix
let the column rank of be and let cr be any basis for the column space of place these as the columns of an matrix every column of can be expressed as linear combination of the columns in this means that there is an matrix such that cr
is the matrix whose ith column is formed from the coefficients giving the ith column of as linear combination of the columns of in other words is the matrix which contains the multiples for the bases of the column space of which is which are then used to form as whole
now each row of is given by linear combination of the rows of therefore the rows of form spanning set of the row space of and by the steinitz exchange lemma the row rank of cannot exceed this proves that the row rank of is less than or equal to the column rank of this result can be applied to any matrix so apply the result to the transpose of since the row rank of the transpose of is the column rank of and the column rank of the transpose of is the row rank of this establishes the reverse inequality and we obtain the equality of the row rank and the column rank of
also see rank factorization
proof using orthogonality let be an matrix with entries in the real numbers whose row rank is therefore the dimension of the row space of is let xr be basis of the row space of we claim that the vectors ax ax axr are linearly independent
to see why consider linear homogeneous relation involving these vectors with scalar coefficients cr where crxr
we make two observations is linear combination of vectors in the row space of which implies that belongs to the row space of and since av the vector is orthogonal to every row vector of and hence is orthogonal to every vector in the row space of the facts and together imply that is orthogonal to itself which proves that or by the definition of but recall that the xi were chosen as basis of the row space of and so are linearly independent
this implies that cr it follows that ax ax axr are linearly independent
now each axi is obviously vector in the column space of so ax ax axr is set of linearly independent vectors in the column space of and hence the dimension of the column space of the column rank of must be at least as big as this proves that row rank of is no larger than the column rank of now apply this result to the transpose of to get the reverse inequality and conclude as in the previous proof
alternative definitions in all the definitions in this section the matrix is taken to be an matrix over an arbitrary field dimension of image given the matrix there is an associated linear mapping defined by the rank of is the dimension of the image of this definition has the advantage that it can be applied to any linear map without need for specific matrix
rank in terms of nullity given the same linear mapping as above the rank is minus the dimension of the kernel of the rank nullity theorem states that this definition is equivalent to the preceding one
column rank dimension of column space the rank of is the maximal number of linearly independent columns of this is the dimension of the column space of the column space being the subspace of fm generated by the columns of which is in fact just the image of the linear map associated to
row rank dimension of row space the rank of is the maximal number of linearly independent rows of this is the dimension of the row space of
decomposition rank the rank of is the smallest integer such that can be factored as where is an matrix and is matrix
in fact for all integers the following are equivalent the column rank of is less than or equal to there exist columns of size such that every column of is linear combination of there exist an matrix and matrix such that when is the rank this is rank factorization of there exist rows of size such that every row of is linear combination of the row rank of is less than or equal to indeed the following equivalences are obvious
for example to prove from take to be the matrix whose columns are from
to prove from take to be the columns of it follows from the equivalence that the row rank is equal to the column rank
as in the case of the dimension of image characterization this can be generalized to definition of the rank of any linear map the rank of linear map is the minimal dimension of an intermediate space such that can be written as the composition of map and map unfortunately this definition does not suggest an efficient manner to compute the rank for which it is better to use one of the alternative definitions
see rank factorization for details
rank in terms of singular values the rank of equals the number of non zero singular values which is the same as the number of non zero diagonal elements in in the singular value decomposition
determinantal rank size of largest non vanishing minor the rank of is the largest order of any non zero minor in
the order of minor is the side length of the square sub matrix of which it is the determinant
like the decomposition rank characterization this does not give an efficient way of computing the rank but it is useful theoretically single non zero minor witnesses lower bound namely its order for the rank of the matrix which can be useful for example to prove that certain operations do not lower the rank of matrix
non vanishing minor submatrix with non zero determinant shows that the rows and columns of that submatrix are linearly independent and thus those rows and columns of the full matrix are linearly independent in the full matrix so the row and column rank are at least as large as the determinantal rank however the converse is less straightforward
the equivalence of determinantal rank and column rank is strengthening of the statement that if the span of vectors has dimension then of those vectors span the space equivalently that one can choose spanning set that is subset of the vectors the equivalence implies that subset of the rows and subset of the columns simultaneously define an invertible submatrix equivalently if the span of vectors has dimension then of these vectors span the space and there is set of coordinates on which they are linearly independent
tensor rank minimum number of simple tensors the rank of is the smallest number such that can be written as sum of rank matrices where matrix is defined to have rank if and only if it can be written as nonzero product of column vector and row vector this notion of rank is called tensor rank it can be generalized in the separable models interpretation of the singular value decomposition
properties we assume that is an matrix and we define the linear map by ax as above
the rank of an matrix is nonnegative integer and cannot be greater than either or that is matrix that has rank min is said to have full rank otherwise the matrix is rank deficient
only zero matrix has rank zero
is injective or one to one if and only if has rank in this case we say that has full column rank
is surjective or onto if and only if has rank in this case we say that has full row rank
if is square matrix then is invertible if and only if has rank that is has full rank
if is any matrix then if is an matrix of rank then if is an matrix of rank then the rank of is equal to if and only if there exists an invertible matrix and an invertible matrix such that where ir denotes the identity matrix
sylvester rank inequality if is an matrix and is then this is special case of the next inequality
the inequality due to frobenius if ab abc and bc are defined then subadditivity when and are of the same dimension
as consequence rank matrix can be written as the sum of rank matrices but not fewer
the rank of matrix plus the nullity of the matrix equals the number of columns of the matrix
this is the rank nullity theorem
if is matrix over the real numbers then the rank of and the rank of its corresponding gram matrix are equal
thus for real matrices this can be shown by proving equality of their null spaces
the null space of the gram matrix is given by vectors for which if this condition is fulfilled we also have if is matrix over the complex numbers and denotes the complex conjugate of and the conjugate transpose of the adjoint of then applications one useful application of calculating the rank of matrix is the computation of the number of solutions of system of linear equations
according to the rouch capelli theorem the system is inconsistent if the rank of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix
if on the other hand the ranks of these two matrices are equal then the system must have at least one solution
the solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables
otherwise the general solution has free parameters where is the difference between the number of variables and the rank
in this case and assuming the system of equations is in the real or complex numbers the system of equations has infinitely many solutions
in control theory the rank of matrix can be used to determine whether linear system is controllable or observable
in the field of communication complexity the rank of the communication matrix of function gives bounds on the amount of communication needed for two parties to compute the function
generalization there are different generalizations of the concept of rank to matrices over arbitrary rings where column rank row rank dimension of column space and dimension of row space of matrix may be different from the others or may not exist
thinking of matrices as tensors the tensor rank generalizes to arbitrary tensors for tensors of order greater than matrices are order tensors rank is very hard to compute unlike for matrices
there is notion of rank for smooth maps between smooth manifolds
it is equal to the linear rank of the derivative
matrices as tensors matrix rank should not be confused with tensor order which is called tensor rank
tensor order is the number of indices required to write tensor and thus matrices all have tensor order more precisely matrices are tensors of type having one row index and one column index also called covariant order and contravariant order see tensor intrinsic definition for details
the tensor rank of matrix can also mean the minimum number of simple tensors necessary to express the matrix as linear combination and that this definition does agree with matrix rank as here discussed

dandy is man who places particular importance upon physical appearance refined language and leisurely hobbies pursued with the appearance of nonchalance
dandy could be self made man who strove to imitate an aristocratic lifestyle despite coming from middle class background especially in late th and early th century britain
previous manifestations of the petit ma tre french for small master and the muscadin have been noted by john prevost but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary both in london and in paris
the dandy cultivated cynical reserve yet to such extremes that novelist george meredith himself no dandy once defined cynicism as intellectual dandyism
some took more benign view thomas carlyle wrote in sartor resartus that dandy was no more than clothes wearing man
honor de balzac introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved henri de marsay in la fille aux yeux or part of la com die humaine who fulfils at first the model of perfect dandy until an obsessive love pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy
charles baudelaire defined the dandy in the later metaphysical phase of dandyism as one who elevates aesthetics to living religion that the dandy mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to stoicism and these beings have no other status but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons of satisfying their passions of feeling and thinking
dandyism is form of romanticism
contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance
for the perfect dandy these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind
the linkage of clothing with political protest had become particularly english characteristic during the th century
given these connotations dandyism can be seen as political protest against the levelling effect of egalitarian principles often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre industrial values such as the ideals of the perfect gentleman or the autonomous aristocrat
paradoxically the dandy required an audience as susann schmid observed in examining the successfully marketed lives of oscar wilde and lord byron who exemplify the dandy roles in the public sphere both as writers and as personae providing sources of gossip and scandal
nigel rodgers in the dandy peacock or enigma
questions wilde status as genuine dandy seeing him as someone who only assumed dandified stance in passing not man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism
etymology the origin of the word is uncertain
eccentricity defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes began to be applied generally to human behavior in the
similarly the word dandy first appears in the late th century
in the years immediately preceding the american revolution the first verse and chorus of yankee doodle derided the perceived poverty and rustic manners of american colonists suggesting that whereas fine horse and gold braided clothing mac aroni were required to set dandy apart from those around him the average american colonist means were so meager that ownership of mere pony and few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as dandy by comparison to and or in the minds of his even less sophisticated eurasian compatriots
slightly later scottish border ballad circa also features the word but probably without all the contextual aspects of its more recent meaning
the original full form of dandy may have been jack dandy
it was vogue word during the napoleonic wars
in that contemporary slang dandy was differentiated from fop in that the dandy dress was more refined and sober than the fop
in the twenty first century the word dandy is jocular often sarcastic adjective meaning fine or great when used in the form of noun it refers to well groomed and well dressed man but often to one who is also self absorbed
beau brummell and early british dandyism the model dandy in british society was george bryan beau brummell in his early days an undergraduate student at oriel college oxford and later an associate of the prince regent
brummell was not from an aristocratic background indeed his greatness was based on nothing at all as
barbey aurevilly observed in never unpowdered or unperfumed immaculately bathed and shaved and dressed in plain dark blue coat he was always perfectly brushed perfectly fitted showing much perfectly starched linen all freshly laundered and composed with an elaborately knotted cravat
from the mid beau brummell was the early incarnation of the celebrity man chiefly famous for being famous by the time pitt taxed hair powder in to help pay for the war against france and to discourage the use of flour which had recently increased in both rarity and price owing to bad harvests in such frivolous product brummell had already abandoned wearing wig and had his hair cut in the roman fashion la brutus
moreover he led the transition from breeches to snugly tailored dark pantaloons which directly led to modern trousers the sartorial mainstay of men clothes in the western world for the past two centuries
in upon coming of age beau brummell inherited from his father fortune of thirty thousand pounds which he spent mostly on costume gambling and high living
in he suffered bankruptcy the dandy stereotyped fate he fled his creditors to france quietly dying in in lunatic asylum in caen aged men of more notable accomplishments than beau brummell also adopted the dandiacal pose lord byron occasionally dressed the part helping reintroduce the frilled lace cuffed and lace collared poet shirt
in that spirit he had his portrait painted in albanian costume another prominent dandy of the period was alfred guillaume gabriel orsay the count orsay who had been friends with byron and who moved in the highest social circles of london
thomas carlyle in sartor resartus wrote dandy is clothes wearing man man whose trade office and existence consists in the wearing of clothes
every faculty of his soul spirit purse and person is heroically consecrated to this one object the wearing of clothes wisely and well so that as others dress to live he lives to dress and now for all this perennial martyrdom and poesy and even prophecy what is it that the dandy asks in return
solely we may say that you would recognise his existence would admit him to be living object or even failing this visual object or thing that will reflect rays of light by the mid th century the english dandy within the muted palette of male fashion exhibited minute refinements the quality of the fine woollen cloth the slope of pocket flap or coat revers exactly the right colour for the gloves the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes and so on
it was an image of well dressed man who while taking infinite pains about his appearance affected indifference to it
this refined dandyism continued to be regarded as an essential strand of male englishness
dandyism in france the beginnings of dandyism in france were bound to the politics of the french revolution the initial stage of dandyism the gilded youth was political statement of dressing in an aristocratic style to distinguish its members from the sans culottes
during his heyday beau brummell dictat on both fashion and etiquette reigned supreme
his habits of dress and fashion were much imitated especially in france where in curious development they became the rage especially in bohemian quarters
there dandies sometimes were celebrated in revolutionary terms self created men of consciously designed personality radically breaking with past traditions
with elaborate dress and idle decadent styles of life french bohemian dandies sought to convey contempt for and superiority to bourgeois society
in the latter th century this fancy dress bohemianism was major influence on the symbolist movement in french literature baudelaire was deeply interested in dandyism and memorably wrote that dandy aspirant must have no profession other than elegance
no other status but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons
the dandy must aspire to be sublime without interruption he must live and sleep before mirror
other french intellectuals also were interested in the dandies strolling the streets and boulevards of paris
jules am barbey aurevilly wrote on dandyism and george brummell an essay devoted in great measure to examining the career of beau brummell
later dandyism the literary dandy is familiar figure in the writings and sometimes the self presentation of oscar wilde
munro clovis and reginald
wodehouse bertie wooster and ronald firbank writers linked by their subversive air
the poets algernon charles swinburne and oscar wilde walter pater the american artist james mcneill whistler joris karl huysmans and max beerbohm were dandies of the belle poque as was robert de montesquiou marcel proust inspiration for the baron de charlus
in italy gabriele annunzio and carlo bugatti exemplified the artistic bohemian dandyism of the fin de siecle
wilde wrote that one should either be work of art or wear work of art
at the end of the th century american dandies were called dudes
evander berry wall was nicknamed the king of the dudes
george walden in the essay who dandy identifies no coward andy warhol and quentin crisp as modern dandies
the character psmith in the novels of wodehouse is considered dandy both physically and intellectually
agatha christie poirot is said to be dandy
the artist sebastian horsley described himself as dandy in the underworld in his eponymous autobiography in japan dandyism has become fashion subculture with historical roots dating back to the edo period in spain during the early th century curious phenomenon developed linked to the idea of dandyism
while in england and france individuals from the middle classes adopted aristocratic manners the spanish aristocracy adopted the fashions of the lower classes called majos
they were characterized by their elaborate outfits and sense of style as opposed to the modern frenchified afrancesados as for their cheeky arrogant attitude
some famous dandies in later times were amongst other the duke of osuna mariano tellez gir artist salvador dal and poet lu cernuda
later thought albert camus said in homme volt that the dandy creates his own unity by aesthetic means
but it is an aesthetic of negation
to live and die before mirror that according to baudelaire was the dandy slogan
it is indeed coherent slogan
the dandy is by occupation always in opposition
he can only exist by defiance
the dandy therefore is always compelled to astonish
singularity is his vocation excess his way to perfection
perpetually incomplete always on the fringe of things he compels others to create him while denying their values
he plays at life because he is unable to live it
jean baudrillard said that dandyism is an aesthetic form of nihilism
quaintrelle the female counterpart is quaintrelle woman who emphasizes life of passion expressed through personal style leisurely pastimes charm and cultivation of life pleasures
in the th century cointerrels male and cointrelles female emerged based upon coint word applied to things skillfully made later indicating person of beautiful dress and refined speech
by the th century coint became quaint indicating elegant speech and beauty
middle english dictionaries note quaintrelle as beautifully dressed woman or overly dressed but do not include the favorable personality elements of grace and charm
the notion of quaintrelle sharing the major philosophical components of refinement with dandies is modern development that returns quaintrelles to their historic roots
female dandies did overlap with male dandies for brief period during the early th century when dandy had derisive definition of fop or over the top fellow the female equivalents were dandyess or dandizette
charles dickens in all the year around comments the dandies and dandizettes of must have been strange race
dandizette was term applied to the feminine devotees to dress and their absurdities were fully equal to those of the dandies
in charms of dandyism in three volumes was published by olivia moreland chief of the female dandies most likely one of many pseudonyms used by thomas ashe
olivia moreland may have existed as ashe did write several novels about living persons
throughout the novel dandyism is associated with living in style
later as the word dandy evolved to denote refinement it became applied solely to men
popular culture and performance in the victorian city notes this evolution in the latter th century
or dandizette although the term was increasingly reserved for men
in popular culture jason king the series featured the further adventures of the title character played by peter wyngarde who had first appeared in department
in that series he was dilettante dandy and author of series of adventure novels working as part of team of investigators
in jason king he had left that service to concentrate on writing the adventures of mark caine who closely resembled jason king in looks manner style and personality
none of the other regular characters from department appeared in this series although department itself is occasionally referred to in dialogue

linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as linear maps such as and their representations in vector spaces and through matrices linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics
for instance linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry including for defining basic objects such as lines planes and rotations
also functional analysis branch of mathematical analysis may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions
linear algebra is also used in most sciences and fields of engineering because it allows modeling many natural phenomena and computing efficiently with such models
for nonlinear systems which cannot be modeled with linear algebra it is often used for dealing with first order approximations using the fact that the differential of multivariate function at point is the linear map that best approximates the function near that point
history the procedure using counting rods for solving simultaneous linear equations now called gaussian elimination appears in the ancient chinese mathematical text chapter eight rectangular arrays of the nine chapters on the mathematical art
its use is illustrated in eighteen problems with two to five equations systems of linear equations arose in europe with the introduction in by ren descartes of coordinates in geometry
in fact in this new geometry now called cartesian geometry lines and planes are represented by linear equations and computing their intersections amounts to solving systems of linear equations
the first systematic methods for solving linear systems used determinants and were first considered by leibniz in in gabriel cramer used them for giving explicit solutions of linear systems now called cramer rule
later gauss further described the method of elimination which was initially listed as an advancement in geodesy in hermann grassmann published his theory of extension which included foundational new topics of what is today called linear algebra
in james joseph sylvester introduced the term matrix which is latin for womb
linear algebra grew with ideas noted in the complex plane
for instance two numbers and in have difference and the line segments wz and are of the same length and direction
the segments are equipollent
the four dimensional system of quaternions was started in the term vector was introduced as xi yj zk representing point in space
the quaternion difference also produces segment equipollent to pq
other hypercomplex number systems also used the idea of linear space with basis
arthur cayley introduced matrix multiplication and the inverse matrix in making possible the general linear group
the mechanism of group representation became available for describing complex and hypercomplex numbers
crucially cayley used single letter to denote matrix thus treating matrix as an aggregate object
he also realized the connection between matrices and determinants and wrote there would be many things to say about this theory of matrices which should it seems to me precede the theory of determinants benjamin peirce published his linear associative algebra and his son charles sanders peirce extended the work later the telegraph required an explanatory system and the publication of treatise on electricity and magnetism instituted field theory of forces and required differential geometry for expression
linear algebra is flat differential geometry and serves in tangent spaces to manifolds
electromagnetic symmetries of spacetime are expressed by the lorentz transformations and much of the history of linear algebra is the history of lorentz transformations
the first modern and more precise definition of vector space was introduced by peano in by theory of linear transformations of finite dimensional vector spaces had emerged
linear algebra took its modern form in the first half of the twentieth century when many ideas and methods of previous centuries were generalized as abstract algebra
the development of computers led to increased research in efficient algorithms for gaussian elimination and matrix decompositions and linear algebra became an essential tool for modelling and simulations
vector spaces until the th century linear algebra was introduced through systems of linear equations and matrices
in modern mathematics the presentation through vector spaces is generally preferred since it is more synthetic more general not limited to the finite dimensional case and conceptually simpler although more abstract
vector space over field often the field of the real numbers is set equipped with two binary operations satisfying the following axioms
elements of are called vectors and elements of are called scalars
the first operation vector addition takes any two vectors and and outputs third vector the second operation scalar multiplication takes any scalar and any vector and outputs new vector av
the axioms that addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy are the following
in the list below and are arbitrary elements of and and are arbitrary scalars in the field the first four axioms mean that is an abelian group under addition
an element of specific vector space may have various nature for example it could be sequence function polynomial or matrix
linear algebra is concerned with those properties of such objects that are common to all vector spaces
linear maps linear maps are mappings between vector spaces that preserve the vector space structure
given two vector spaces and over field linear map also called in some contexts linear transformation or linear mapping is map that is compatible with addition and scalar multiplication that is for any vectors in and scalar in this implies that for any vectors in and scalars in one has when are the same vector space linear map is also known as linear operator on bijective linear map between two vector spaces that is every vector from the second space is associated with exactly one in the first is an isomorphism
because an isomorphism preserves linear structure two isomorphic vector spaces are essentially the same from the linear algebra point of view in the sense that they cannot be distinguished by using vector space properties
an essential question in linear algebra is testing whether linear map is an isomorphism or not and if it is not an isomorphism finding its range or image and the set of elements that are mapped to the zero vector called the kernel of the map
all these questions can be solved by using gaussian elimination or some variant of this algorithm
subspaces span and basis the study of those subsets of vector spaces that are in themselves vector spaces under the induced operations is fundamental similarly as for many mathematical structures
these subsets are called linear subspaces
more precisely linear subspace of vector space over field is subset of such that and au are in for every in and every in these conditions suffice for implying that is vector space
for example given linear map the image of and the inverse image of called kernel or null space are linear subspaces of and respectively
another important way of forming subspace is to consider linear combinations of set of vectors the set of all sums where vk are in and ak are in form linear subspace called the span of the span of is also the intersection of all linear subspaces containing in other words it is the smallest for the inclusion relation linear subspace containing set of vectors is linearly independent if none is in the span of the others
equivalently set of vectors is linearly independent if the only way to express the zero vector as linear combination of elements of is to take zero for every coefficient ai
set of vectors that spans vector space is called spanning set or generating set
if spanning set is linearly dependent that is not linearly independent then some element of is in the span of the other elements of and the span would remain the same if one remove from one may continue to remove elements of until getting linearly independent spanning set
such linearly independent set that spans vector space is called basis of the importance of bases lies in the fact that they are simultaneously minimal generating sets and maximal independent sets
more precisely if is linearly independent set and is spanning set such that then there is basis such that any two bases of vector space have the same cardinality which is called the dimension of this is the dimension theorem for vector spaces
moreover two vector spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension if any basis of and therefore every basis has finite number of elements is finite dimensional vector space
if is subspace of then dim dim in the case where is finite dimensional the equality of the dimensions implies if and are subspaces of then dim dim dim dim where denotes the span of
matrices matrices allow explicit manipulation of finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps
their theory is thus an essential part of linear algebra
let be finite dimensional vector space over field and vm be basis of thus is the dimension of
by definition of basis the map is bijection from fm the set of the sequences of elements of onto this is an isomorphism of vector spaces if fm is equipped of its standard structure of vector space where vector addition and scalar multiplication are done component by component
this isomorphism allows representing vector by its inverse image under this isomorphism that is by the coordinate vector am or by the column matrix
if is another finite dimensional vector space possibly the same with basis wn linear map from to is well defined by its values on the basis elements that is wn
thus is well represented by the list of the corresponding column matrices
that is if for then is represented by the matrix with rows and columns
matrix multiplication is defined in such way that the product of two matrices is the matrix of the composition of the corresponding linear maps and the product of matrix and column matrix is the column matrix representing the result of applying the represented linear map to the represented vector
it follows that the theory of finite dimensional vector spaces and the theory of matrices are two different languages for expressing exactly the same concepts
two matrices that encode the same linear transformation in different bases are called similar
it can be proved that two matrices are similar if and only if one can transform one into the other by elementary row and column operations
for matrix representing linear map from to the row operations correspond to change of bases in and the column operations correspond to change of bases in every matrix is similar to an identity matrix possibly bordered by zero rows and zero columns
in terms of vector spaces this means that for any linear map from to there are bases such that part of the basis of is mapped bijectively on part of the basis of and that the remaining basis elements of if any are mapped to zero
gaussian elimination is the basic algorithm for finding these elementary operations and proving these results
linear systems finite set of linear equations in finite set of variables for example xn or is called system of linear equations or linear system systems of linear equations form fundamental part of linear algebra
historically linear algebra and matrix theory has been developed for solving such systems
in the modern presentation of linear algebra through vector spaces and matrices many problems may be interpreted in terms of linear systems
for example let be linear system
to such system one may associate its matrix
and its right member vector
let be the linear transformation associated to the matrix solution of the system is vector such that that is an element of the preimage of by let be the associated homogeneous system where the right hand sides of the equations are put to zero the solutions of are exactly the elements of the kernel of or equivalently the gaussian elimination consists of performing elementary row operations on the augmented matrix for putting it in reduced row echelon form
these row operations do not change the set of solutions of the system of equations
in the example the reduced echelon form is showing that the system has the unique solution it follows from this matrix interpretation of linear systems that the same methods can be applied for solving linear systems and for many operations on matrices and linear transformations which include the computation of the ranks kernels matrix inverses
endomorphisms and square matrices linear endomorphism is linear map that maps vector space to itself
if has basis of elements such an endomorphism is represented by square matrix of size with respect to general linear maps linear endomorphisms and square matrices have some specific properties that make their study an important part of linear algebra which is used in many parts of mathematics including geometric transformations coordinate changes quadratic forms and many other part of mathematics
determinant the determinant of square matrix is defined to be where sn is the group of all permutations of elements is permutation and the parity of the permutation
matrix is invertible if and only if the determinant is invertible nonzero if the scalars belong to field
cramer rule is closed form expression in terms of determinants of the solution of system of linear equations in unknowns
cramer rule is useful for reasoning about the solution but except for or it is rarely used for computing solution since gaussian elimination is faster algorithm
the determinant of an endomorphism is the determinant of the matrix representing the endomorphism in terms of some ordered basis
this definition makes sense since this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis
eigenvalues and eigenvectors if is linear endomorphism of vector space over field an eigenvector of is nonzero vector of such that av for some scalar in this scalar is an eigenvalue of if the dimension of is finite and basis has been chosen and may be represented respectively by square matrix and column matrix the equation defining eigenvectors and eigenvalues becomes using the identity matrix whose entries are all zero except those of the main diagonal which are equal to one this may be rewritten as is supposed to be nonzero this means that ai is singular matrix and thus that its determinant det ai equals zero
the eigenvalues are thus the roots of the polynomial det
if is of dimension this is monic polynomial of degree called the characteristic polynomial of the matrix or of the endomorphism and there are at most eigenvalues
if basis exists that consists only of eigenvectors the matrix of on this basis has very simple structure it is diagonal matrix such that the entries on the main diagonal are eigenvalues and the other entries are zero
in this case the endomorphism and the matrix are said to be diagonalizable
more generally an endomorphism and matrix are also said diagonalizable if they become diagonalizable after extending the field of scalars
in this extended sense if the characteristic polynomial is square free then the matrix is diagonalizable
symmetric matrix is always diagonalizable
there are non diagonalizable matrices the simplest being it cannot be diagonalizable since its square is the zero matrix and the square of nonzero diagonal matrix is never zero
when an endomorphism is not diagonalizable there are bases on which it has simple form although not as simple as the diagonal form
the frobenius normal form does not need of extending the field of scalars and makes the characteristic polynomial immediately readable on the matrix
the jordan normal form requires to extend the field of scalar for containing all eigenvalues and differs from the diagonal form only by some entries that are just above the main diagonal and are equal to
duality linear form is linear map from vector space over field to the field of scalars viewed as vector space over itself
equipped by pointwise addition and multiplication by scalar the linear forms form vector space called the dual space of and usually denoted or if vn is basis of this implies that is finite dimensional then one can define for linear map vi such that vi vi and vi vj if these linear maps form basis of called the dual basis of vn
if is not finite dimensional the vi may be defined similarly they are linearly independent but do not form basis
for in the map is linear form on
this defines the canonical linear map from into the dual of called the bidual of this canonical map is an isomorphism if is finite dimensional and this allows identifying with its bidual
in the infinite dimensional case the canonical map is injective but not surjective
there is thus complete symmetry between finite dimensional vector space and its dual
this motivates the frequent use in this context of the bra ket notation for denoting
dual map let be linear map
for every linear form on the composite function is linear form on this defines linear map between the dual spaces which is called the dual or the transpose of if and are finite dimensional and is the matrix of in terms of some ordered bases then the matrix of over the dual bases is the transpose mt of obtained by exchanging rows and columns
if elements of vector spaces and their duals are represented by column vectors this duality may be expressed in bra ket notation by
for highlighting this symmetry the two members of this equality are sometimes written
inner product spaces besides these basic concepts linear algebra also studies vector spaces with additional structure such as an inner product
the inner product is an example of bilinear form and it gives the vector space geometric structure by allowing for the definition of length and angles
formally an inner product is map that satisfies the following three axioms for all vectors in and all scalars in conjugate symmetry
in it is symmetric linearity in the first argument
positive definiteness with equality only for we can define the length of vector in by and we can prove the cauchy schwarz inequality
in particular the quantity and so we can call this quantity the cosine of the angle between the two vectors
two vectors are orthogonal if an orthonormal basis is basis where all basis vectors have length and are orthogonal to each other
given any finite dimensional vector space an orthonormal basis could be found by the gram schmidt procedure
orthonormal bases are particularly easy to deal with since if an vn then
the inner product facilitates the construction of many useful concepts
for instance given transform we can define its hermitian conjugate as the linear transform satisfying
if satisfies tt we call normal
it turns out that normal matrices are precisely the matrices that have an orthonormal system of eigenvectors that span relationship with geometry there is strong relationship between linear algebra and geometry which started with the introduction by ren descartes in of cartesian coordinates
in this new at that time geometry now called cartesian geometry points are represented by cartesian coordinates which are sequences of three real numbers in the case of the usual three dimensional space
the basic objects of geometry which are lines and planes are represented by linear equations
thus computing intersections of lines and planes amounts to solving systems of linear equations
this was one of the main motivations for developing linear algebra
most geometric transformation such as translations rotations reflections rigid motions isometries and projections transform lines into lines
it follows that they can be defined specified and studied in terms of linear maps
this is also the case of homographies and bius transformations when considered as transformations of projective space
until the end of the th century geometric spaces were defined by axioms relating points lines and planes synthetic geometry
around this date it appeared that one may also define geometric spaces by constructions involving vector spaces see for example projective space and affine space
it has been shown that the two approaches are essentially equivalent
in classical geometry the involved vector spaces are vector spaces over the reals but the constructions may be extended to vector spaces over any field allowing considering geometry over arbitrary fields including finite fields
presently most textbooks introduce geometric spaces from linear algebra and geometry is often presented at elementary level as subfield of linear algebra
usage and applications linear algebra is used in almost all areas of mathematics thus making it relevant in almost all scientific domains that use mathematics
these applications may be divided into several wide categories
geometry of ambient space the modeling of ambient space is based on geometry
sciences concerned with this space use geometry widely
this is the case with mechanics and robotics for describing rigid body dynamics geodesy for describing earth shape perspectivity computer vision and computer graphics for describing the relationship between scene and its plane representation and many other scientific domains
in all these applications synthetic geometry is often used for general descriptions and qualitative approach but for the study of explicit situations one must compute with coordinates
this requires the heavy use of linear algebra
functional analysis functional analysis studies function spaces
these are vector spaces with additional structure such as hilbert spaces
linear algebra is thus fundamental part of functional analysis and its applications which include in particular quantum mechanics wave functions
study of complex systems most physical phenomena are modeled by partial differential equations
to solve them one usually decomposes the space in which the solutions are searched into small mutually interacting cells
for linear systems this interaction involves linear functions
for nonlinear systems this interaction is often approximated by linear functions this is called linear model or first order approximation
linear models are frequently used for complex nonlinear real world systems because it makes parametrization more manageable
in both cases very large matrices are generally involved
weather forecasting or more specifically parametrization for atmospheric modeling is typical example of real world application where the whole earth atmosphere is divided into cells of say km of width and km of height
scientific computation nearly all scientific computations involve linear algebra
consequently linear algebra algorithms have been highly optimized
blas and lapack are the best known implementations
for improving efficiency some of them configure the algorithms automatically at run time for adapting them to the specificities of the computer cache size number of available cores
some processors typically graphics processing units gpu are designed with matrix structure for optimizing the operations of linear algebra
extensions and generalizations this section presents several related topics that do not appear generally in elementary textbooks on linear algebra but are commonly considered in advanced mathematics as parts of linear algebra
module theory the existence of multiplicative inverses in fields is not involved in the axioms defining vector space
one may thus replace the field of scalars by ring and this gives structure called module over or module
the concepts of linear independence span basis and linear maps also called module homomorphisms are defined for modules exactly as for vector spaces with the essential difference that if is not field there are modules that do not have any basis
the modules that have basis are the free modules and those that are spanned by finite set are the finitely generated modules
module homomorphisms between finitely generated free modules may be represented by matrices
the theory of matrices over ring is similar to that of matrices over field except that determinants exist only if the ring is commutative and that square matrix over commutative ring is invertible only if its determinant has multiplicative inverse in the ring
vector spaces are completely characterized by their dimension up to an isomorphism
in general there is not such complete classification for modules even if one restricts oneself to finitely generated modules
however every module is cokernel of homomorphism of free modules
modules over the integers can be identified with abelian groups since the multiplication by an integer may identified to repeated addition
most of the theory of abelian groups may be extended to modules over principal ideal domain
in particular over principal ideal domain every submodule of free module is free and the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups may be extended straightforwardly to finitely generated modules over principal ring
there are many rings for which there are algorithms for solving linear equations and systems of linear equations
however these algorithms have generally computational complexity that is much higher than the similar algorithms over field
for more details see linear equation over ring
multilinear algebra and tensors in multilinear algebra one considers multivariable linear transformations that is mappings that are linear in each of number of different variables
this line of inquiry naturally leads to the idea of the dual space the vector space consisting of linear maps where is the field of scalars
multilinear maps vn can be described via tensor products of elements of
if in addition to vector addition and scalar multiplication there is bilinear vector product the vector space is called an algebra for instance associative algebras are algebras with an associate vector product like the algebra of square matrices or the algebra of polynomials
topological vector spaces vector spaces that are not finite dimensional often require additional structure to be tractable
normed vector space is vector space along with function called norm which measures the size of elements
the norm induces metric which measures the distance between elements and induces topology which allows for definition of continuous maps
the metric also allows for definition of limits and completeness metric space that is complete is known as banach space
complete metric space along with the additional structure of an inner product conjugate symmetric sesquilinear form is known as hilbert space which is in some sense particularly well behaved banach space
functional analysis applies the methods of linear algebra alongside those of mathematical analysis to study various function spaces the central objects of study in functional analysis are lp spaces which are banach spaces and especially the space of square integrable functions which is the only hilbert space among them
functional analysis is of particular importance to quantum mechanics the theory of partial differential equations digital signal processing and electrical engineering
it also provides the foundation and theoretical framework that underlies the fourier transform and related methods

in coding theory parity check matrix of linear block code is matrix which describes the linear relations that the components of codeword must satisfy
it can be used to decide whether particular vector is codeword and is also used in decoding algorithms
definition formally parity check matrix of linear code is generator matrix of the dual code
this means that codeword is in if and only if the matrix vector product hc some authors would write this in an equivalent form ch
the rows of parity check matrix are the coefficients of the parity check equations
that is they show how linear combinations of certain digits components of each codeword equal zero
for example the parity check matrix compactly represents the parity check equations that must be satisfied for the vector to be codeword of from the definition of the parity check matrix it directly follows the minimum distance of the code is the minimum number such that every columns of parity check matrix are linearly independent while there exist columns of that are linearly dependent
creating parity check matrix the parity check matrix for given code can be derived from its generator matrix and vice versa
if the generator matrix for an code is in standard form then the parity check matrix is given by because negation is performed in the finite field fq
note that if the characteristic of the underlying field is in that field as in binary codes then so the negation is unnecessary
for example if binary code has the generator matrix then its parity check matrix is it can be verified that is matrix while is matrix
syndromes for any row vector of the ambient vector space hx is called the syndrome of the vector is codeword if and only if the calculation of syndromes is the basis for the syndrome decoding algorithm

introduction to coding theory
information is an abstract concept that refers to that which has the power to inform
at the most fundamental level information pertains to the interpretation of that which may be sensed
any natural process that is not completely random and any observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information
whereas digital signals and other data use discrete signs to convey information other phenomena and artifacts such as analog signals poems pictures music or other sounds and currents convey information in more continuous form
information is not knowledge itself but the meaning that may be derived from representation through interpretation information is often processed iteratively data available at one step are processed into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step
for example in written text each symbol or letter conveys information relevant to the word it is part of each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of and so on until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in given domain
in digital signal bits may be interpreted into the symbols letters numbers or structures that convey the information available at the next level up
the key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing
the concept of information is relevant in various contexts including those of constraint communication control data form education knowledge meaning understanding mental stimuli pattern perception proposition representation and entropy
the derivation of information from signal or message may be thought of as the resolution of ambiguity or uncertainty that arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message information may be structured as data
redundant data can be compressed up to an optimal size which is the theoretical limit of compression
the information available through collection of data may be derived by analysis
for example data may be collected from single customer order at restaurant
the information available from many orders may be analyzed and then becomes knowledge that is put to use when the business subsequently is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish information can be transmitted in time via data storage and space via communication and telecommunication
information is expressed either as the content of message or through direct or indirect observation
that which is perceived can be construed as message in its own right and in that sense all information is always conveyed as the content of message
information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation for example information may be encoded into sequence of signs or transmitted via signal
it can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication
the uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence
uncertainty is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence
information theory takes advantage of this by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty
the bit is typical unit of information
it is that which reduces uncertainty by half
other units such as the nat may be used
for example the information encoded in one fair coin flip is log bit and in two fair coin flips is log bits
science article estimated that of technologically stored information was already in digital bits in and that the year was the beginning of the digital age for information storage with digital storage capacity bypassing analog for the first time
etymology the english word information comes from middle french enformacion informacion information criminal investigation and its etymon latin informati conception teaching creation in english information is an uncountable mass noun
information theory information theory is the scientific study of the quantification storage and communication of information
the field was fundamentally established by the works of harry nyquist and ralph hartley in the and claude shannon in the
the field is at the intersection of probability theory statistics computer science statistical mechanics information engineering and electrical engineering
key measure in information theory is entropy
entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of random variable or the outcome of random process
for example identifying the outcome of fair coin flip with two equally likely outcomes provides less information lower entropy than specifying the outcome from roll of die with six equally likely outcomes
some other important measures in information theory are mutual information channel capacity error exponents and relative entropy
important sub fields of information theory include source coding algorithmic complexity theory algorithmic information theory and information theoretic security
there is another opinion regarding the universal definition of information
it lies in the fact that the concept itself has changed along with the change of various historical epochs and in order to find such definition it is necessary to find common features and patterns of this transformation
for example researchers in the field of information petrichenko and semenova based on retrospective analysis of changes in the concept of information give the following universal definition information is form of transmission of human experience knowledge
in their opinion the change in the essence of the concept of information occurs after various breakthrough technologies for the transfer of experience knowledge
the appearance of writing the printing press the first encyclopedias the telegraph the development of cybernetics the creation of microprocessor the internet smartphones etc
each new form of experience transfer is synthesis of the previous ones
that is why we see such variety of definitions of information because according to the law of dialectics negation negation all previous ideas about information are contained in filmed form and in its modern representation applications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding data compression
for zip files and channel coding error detection and correction
its impact has been crucial to the success of the voyager missions to deep space the invention of the compact disc the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the internet
the theory has also found applications in other areas including statistical inference cryptography neurobiology perception linguistics the evolution and function of molecular codes bioinformatics thermal physics quantum computing black holes information retrieval intelligence gathering plagiarism detection pattern recognition anomaly detection and even art creation
as sensory input often information can be viewed as type of input to an organism or system
inputs are of two kinds some inputs are important to the function of the organism for example food or system energy by themselves
in his book sensory ecology biophysicist david dusenbery called these causal inputs
other inputs information are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of causal input at later time and perhaps another place
some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be connection to causal input
in practice information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or system
for example light is mainly but not only
plants can grow in the direction of the lightsource causal input to plants but for animals it only provides information
the colored light reflected from flower is too weak for photosynthesis but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower where the bee often finds nectar or pollen which are causal inputs serving nutritional function
as representation and complexity the cognitive scientist and applied mathematician ronaldo vigo argues that information is concept that requires at least two related entities to make quantitative sense
these are any dimensionally defined category of objects and any of its subsets in essence is representation of or in other words conveys representational and hence conceptual information about vigo then defines the amount of information that conveys about as the rate of change in the complexity of whenever the objects in are removed from under vigo information pattern invariance complexity representation and information five fundamental constructs of universal science are unified under novel mathematical framework
among other things the framework aims to overcome the limitations of shannon weaver information when attempting to characterize and measure subjective information
as substitute for task wasted time energy and material michael grieves has proposed that the focus on information should be what it does as opposed to defining what it is
grieves has proposed that information can be substituted for wasted physical resources time energy and material for goal oriented tasks
goal oriented tasks can be divided into two components the most cost efficient use of physical resources time energy and material and the additional use of physical resources used by the task this second category is by definition wasted physical resources
information does not substitute or replace the most cost efficient use of physical resources but can be used to replace the wasted physical resources
the condition that this occurs under is that the cost of information is less than the cost of the wasted physical resources
since information is non rival good this can be especially beneficial for repeatable tasks
in manufacturing the task category of the most cost efficient use of physical resources is called lean manufacturing
as an influence that leads to transformation information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns
in this sense there is no need for conscious mind to perceive much less appreciate the pattern
consider for example dna
the sequence of nucleotides is pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for conscious mind
one might argue though that for human to consciously define pattern for example nucleotide naturally involves conscious information processing
systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind and patterns circulating due to feedback in the system can be called information
in other words it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation though not created or presented for that purpose
for example gregory bateson defines information as difference that makes difference if however the premise of influence implies that information has been perceived by conscious mind and also interpreted by it the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge
complex definitions of both information and knowledge make such semantic and logical analysis difficult but the condition of transformation is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge especially in the business discipline of knowledge management
in this practice tools and processes are used to assist knowledge worker in performing research and making decisions including steps such as review information to effectively derive value and meaning reference metadata if available establish relevant context often from many possible contexts derive new knowledge from the information make decisions or recommendations from the resulting knowledgestewart argues that transformation of information into knowledge is critical lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise
the danish dictionary of information terms argues that information only provides an answer to posed question
whether the answer provides knowledge depends on the informed person
so generalized definition of the concept should be information an answer to specific question
when marshall mcluhan speaks of media and their effects on human cultures he refers to the structure of artifacts that in turn shape our behaviors and mindsets
also pheromones are often said to be information in this sense
technologically mediated information these sections are using measurements of data rather than information as information cannot be directly measured
as of it is estimated that the world technological capacity to store information grew from optimally compressed exabytes in which is the informational equivalent to less than one mb cd rom per person mb per person to optimally compressed exabytes in this is the informational equivalent of almost cd rom per person in the world combined technological capacity to receive information through one way broadcast networks was the informational equivalent of newspapers per person per day in the world combined effective capacity to exchange information through two way telecommunication networks was the informational equivalent of newspapers per person per day in as of an estimated of all new information is digital mostly stored on hard drives
as of the total amount of data created captured copied and consumed globally is forecast to increase rapidly reaching zettabytes in over the next five years up to global data creation is projected to grow to more than zettabytes
as records records are specialized forms of information
essentially records are information produced consciously or as by products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value
primarily their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value
sound records management ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required
the international standard on records management iso defines records as information created received and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business
the international committee on archives ica committee on electronic records defined record as recorded information produced or received in the initiation conduct or completion of an institutional or individual activity and that comprises content context and structure sufficient to provide evidence of the activity records may be maintained to retain corporate memory of the organization or to meet legal fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization
willis expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered six key requirements for good corporate governance transparency accountability due process compliance meeting statutory and common law requirements and security of personal and corporate information
semiotics michael buckland has classified information in terms of its uses information as process information as knowledge and information as thing beynon davies explains the multi faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal sign systems
signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter dependent levels layers or branches of semiotics pragmatics semantics syntax and empirics
these four layers serve to connect the social world on the one hand with the physical or technical world on the other
pragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication
pragmatics links the issue of signs with the context within which signs are used
the focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of living agents underlying communicative behaviour
in other words pragmatics link language to action
semantics is concerned with the meaning of message conveyed in communicative act
semantics considers the content of communication
semantics is the study of the meaning of signs the association between signs and behaviour
semantics can be considered as the study of the link between symbols and their referents or concepts particularly the way that signs relate to human behavior
syntax is concerned with the formalism used to represent message
syntax as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems
syntax is devoted to the study of the form rather than the content of signs and sign systems
nielsen discusses the relationship between semiotics and information in relation to dictionaries
he introduces the concept of lexicographic information costs and refers to the effort user of dictionary must make to first find and then understand data so that they can generate information
communication normally exists within the context of some social situation
the social situation sets the context for the intentions conveyed pragmatics and the form of communication
in communicative situation intentions are expressed through messages that comprise collections of inter related signs taken from language mutually understood by the agents involved in the communication
mutual understanding implies that agents involved understand the chosen language in terms of its agreed syntax syntactics and semantics
the sender codes the message in the language and sends the message as signals along some communication channel empirics
the chosen communication channel has inherent properties that determine outcomes such as the speed at which communication can take place and over what distance
the application of information study the information cycle addressed as whole or in its distinct components is of great concern to information technology information systems as well as information science
these fields deal with those processes and techniques pertaining to information capture through sensors and generation through computation formulation or composition processing including encoding encryption compression packaging transmission including all telecommunication methods presentation including visualization display methods storage such as magnetic or optical including holographic methods etc
information visualization shortened as infovis depends on the computation and digital representation of data and assists users in pattern recognition and anomaly detection
information security shortened as infosec is the ongoing process of exercising due diligence to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure destruction modification disruption or distribution through algorithms and procedures focused on monitoring and detection as well as incident response and repair
information analysis is the process of inspecting transforming and modelling information by converting raw data into actionable knowledge in support of the decision making process
information quality shortened as infoq is the potential of dataset to achieve specific scientific or practical goal using given empirical analysis method

viktor amazaspovich ambartsumian russian armenian viktor hamazaspi hambardzumyan september
september august was soviet armenian astrophysicist and science administrator
one of the th century top astronomers he is widely regarded as the founder of theoretical astrophysics in the soviet union
educated at leningrad state university lsu and the pulkovo observatory ambartsumian taught at lsu and founded the soviet union first department of astrophysics there in he subsequently moved to soviet armenia where he founded the byurakan observatory in it became his institutional base for the decades to come and major center of astronomical research
he also co founded the armenian academy of sciences and led it for almost half century the entire post war period
one commentator noted that science in armenia was synonymous with the name ambartsumian
in ambartsumian founded the journal astrofizika and served as its editor for over years
ambartsumian began retiring from the various positions he held only from the age of he died at his house in byurakan and was buried on the grounds of the observatory
he was declared national hero of armenia in
background ambartsumian was born in tiflis on september september in old style to hripsime khakhanian and hamazasp hambardzumyan
hripsime father was an armenian apostolic priest from tskhinvali while hamazasp hailed from vardenis basargechar
his ancestors moved from diyadin what is now turkey to the southern shores of lake sevan in in the aftermath of the russo turkish war
hamazasp russified amazasp was an educated man of letters who studied law at saint petersburg university
he was also writer and translator and notably translated homer iliad into armenian from classical greek
in he co founded the caucasian society of armenian writers which lasted until ambartsumian was the secretary while hovhannes tumanyan the famed poet served as its president ambartsumian parents married in he had brother levon and sister gohar
his brother geophysics student died at while on an expedition in the urals
gohar was mathematician and chair of probability theory and mathematical statistics at yerevan state university towards the end of her life
education ambartsumian developed an early interest in mathematics and was able to multiply by the age of his interest in astronomy began with reading russian translation of book by ormsby mitchel at according to himself he became an astronomer at the age of between and he studied at tiflis gymnasiums and where schooling was done in both russian and armenian
in he transferred to gymnasium to study under nikolay ignatievich sudakov moscow educated astronomer whom ambartsumian called very serious teacher of astronomy
ambartsumian worked with sudakov at the school observatory the latter had built
at school ambartsumian wrote several papers on astronomy and delivered lectures on the origin of the solar system and extraterrestrial life at first in school and then in the various clubs and houses of culture beginning at
in ambartsumian delivered lecture at yerevan state university about the theory of relativity
he also met ashot hovhannisyan and alexander miasnikian armenia communist leaders in ambartsumian moved to leningrad where he began attending the herzen pedagogical institute
according to shakhbazyan it was his non peasant and non proletarian background that kept him from attending leningrad state university lsu
however in an interview ambartsumian stated that it was too late for him to apply to lsu because he arrived in august and admissions were already closed
not to lose year he instead enrolled in the physics and mathematics department at the pedagogical institute
after year he transferred to lsu department of physics and mathematics
at university ambartsumian was interested in both astronomy and mathematics
loved mathematics but at the same time felt that my profession would be astronomy
mathematics was like hobby but did complete the full mathematics curriculum
thus you could say that graduated with major in mathematics but in fact it is recorded that graduated as an astronomer he said in an interview in at lsu among his professors were the physicist orest khvolson and mathematician vladimir smirnov
he studied alongside other major soviet scientists such as lev landau sergei sobolev sergey khristianovich and george gamow
in he published the first of his scholarly papers as student
he graduated in although he received his diploma only fifty years later in his undergraduate thesis was devoted to study of radiative transfer radiative equilibrium
he completed his postgraduate studies at the pulkovo observatory under aristarkh belopolsky between and
career leningrad after completing his postgraduate studies in ambartsumian began working at the pulkovo observatory and teaching part time at lsu
in ambartsumian began reading the first course on theoretical astrophysics in the soviet union
he also served as pulkovo scientific secretary in which involved mostly administrative work
ambartsumian later characterized pulkovo as being very old institution and for this reason there were certain elements of ossification and stagnation
nevertheless this was the best qualified astronomical institution in the soviet union
in ambartsumian was fired by pulkovo director boris gerasimovich for alleged laziness
gerasimovich viewed ambartsumian and other young astrophysicists as undisciplined and in too much of rush to publish untested theories and poorly documented research
gerasimovich himself had tendency to non cooperativeness
gerasimovich was not taken seriously by them
when in subrahmanyan chandrasekhar visited leningrad he was told by ambartsumian look here here is set of papers by gerasimovich
turn to an arbitrary paper and to an arbitrary line
am sure you will find mistake
chandrasekhar stated in that during his visit in ambartsumian was very free and very open
he was extremely critical of his seniors
after leaving pulkovo ambartsumian founded the first department of astrophysics in the soviet union at leningrad state university in in he was named professor at lsu and in he was named doctor of physical mathematical sciences without having to defend thesis based on his scientific work through that date
he headed the department until or between and ambartsumian was the director of the astronomical observatory of lsu
he was simultaneously prorector deputy president of the university
among his graduate students were viktor sobolev benjamin markarian grigor gurzadyan and others
ambartsumian considered sobolev his most brilliant graduate student
stalin purgesmany of ambartsumian colleagues and friends suffered during the great purge under stalin most notably nikolai aleksandrovich kozyrev with whom he became close friends in the mid
kozyrev was sentenced to ten years in forced labor camp but survived the repressions
others such as matvei petrovich bronstein and pulkovo director boris gerasimovich did not survive
ambartsumian relations with kozyrev were strained for the remainder of his life
mccutcheon notes that while in the west some have questioned ambartsumian possible role in the terror there is no hard evidence to suggest that he was guilty of anything more serious than surviving at time when others did not
world war iiambartsumian led the evacuation of part of the faculty of leningrad state university to elabuga yelabuga tatarstan in after the nazi invasion of the soviet union
there branch of lsu operated under ambartsumian leadership until he served as the dean of the branch
armenia in ambartsumian moved with his family to yerevan soviet armenia where he lived until the end of his life
in the same year he co founded the armenian academy of sciences along with scientists and scholars hovsep orbeli hrachia acharian artem alikhanian abram alikhanov manuk abeghian and others
he served as vice president of the academy until and as president from to since ambartsumian served as director of the yerevan astronomical observatory
the small observatory was affiliated with yerevan state university
ambartsumian had secured nine inch telescope from leningrad for the observatory
ambartsumian said that before the war this observatory did not rise significantly above the level of amateur variable star observations
during the war they also carried out photographic observations of variable stars using small camera
in ambartsumian founded the department of astrophysicists at yerevan state university ysu
he was named professor of astrophysics at ysu in he served as chair of the department until in ambartsumian founded the journal astrofizika armenian russian which has been published by the armenian academy of sciences since then
it was originally published in russian subsequently articles in english began to appear
he served as its editor in chief until the journal has also been published since the first issue in english by springer in the us as astrophysics
byurakan in ambartsumian founded the byurakan astrophysical observatory in the village of byurakan at an altitude of ft on the slopes of mount aragats some km mi from yerevan
the first buildings were completed in though the official inauguration took place in observations began to be carried out simultaneous with the construction of the observatory
our instruments stood under the open sky covered with tarpaulin said ambartsumian
ambartsumian initially lived at house in the village of byurakan then build house within the observatory grounds with the money awarded with the stalin prize
ambartsumian directed the byurakan observatory until and was named its honorary director that year
from until his death in the byurakan observatory served as ambartsumian institutional base
in ambartsumian secured schmidt telescope with cm correcting plate and cm mirror for byurakan
the telescope was reportedly made by carl zeiss ag in nazi germany in the and was transferred to leningrad as spoils of war
it was completed in leningrad and sent to armenia
beginning with on ambartsumian initiative benjamin markarian started the first byurakan survey that resulted in the discovery of the markarian galaxies
number of international symposiums and meetings were held at byurakan under ambartsumian supervision
in the observatory was awarded the order of lenin the soviet union highest civilian order for its great merit to the development of science
in ambartsumian supervised the establishment of an astrophysical station of leningrad state university his alma mater within the grounds of the byurakan observatory
it is where graduate students of the lsu did their summer internships until the late
it was shut down in ambartsumian and his disciples at the byurakan observatory became known in the scholarly literature as the byurakan school
from to ambartsumian headed specialized council for theses defenses at byurakan
over scientists defended their phd candidate and doctoral theses on astronomy astrophysics and theoretical physics in those years under ambartsumian
though most of the students were graduates of the astrophysics department of yerevan state university many came from russia georgia ukraine azerbaijan hungary bulgaria and elsewhere
several symposiums of the international astronomical union and numerous conferences were held in byurakan in attendance of jan oort fritz zwicky subrahmanyan chandrasekhar pyotr kapitsa vitaly ginzburg and others
it was also visited by soviet leaders nikita khrushchev and leonid brezhnev with the byurakan observatory ambartsumian put armenia on the astronomical map and made soviet armenia one of the world centers for the study of astrophysics
by the time of his death in the new york times described byurakan as one of the world leading astronomical research centers
as of the byurakan observatory maintained regular contact with research institutions and with scientists from countries
research ambartsumian carried out basic research in astronomy and cosmogony
his research covered astrophysics theoretical physics and mathematical physics
most of his research focused on physics of nebulae star systems and extragalactic astronomy
he is best known for having discovered stellar associations and predicted activity of galactic nuclei
in his later career ambartsumian held views in contradiction to the consequences of the general relativity such as rejecting the existence of black holes
stellar associations in ambartsumian discovered stellar associations new type of stellar system which led to the conclusion that star formation continues to take place in the milky way galaxy
at the time the idea of star formation as an ongoing process was regarded as very speculative
his discovery was announced in short publication by the armenian academy sciences
ambartsumian discovery was based on his observation of stars of and spectral types and tauri and flare stars that cluster very loosely
this is significantly different from open clusters which have higher density of stars while stellar associations have lower than average density
ambartsumian divided stellar associations into ob and groups and concluded that the associations have to be dynamically unstable configurations and must expand subsequently dissolving to form field stars
he thus argued that star forming is ongoing in the galaxy and that stars are born explosively and in groups ambartsumian concept was not immediately accepted
chandrasekhar noted the early scepticism with which this discovery was received by the astronomers of the establishment when first gave an account of ambartsumian paper at the colloquium at the yerkes observatory in late
chandrasekhar noted that ambartsumian discovery of stellar associations had far reaching implications for subsequent theories relating to star formation
mccutcheon noted that the discovery opened an entirely new field of astrophysical research
active galactic nuclei agn ambartsumian began studying nuclei of galaxies in the mid
he found that clusters of galaxies are unstable and that galaxy formation is still ongoing
at the solvay conference on physics in brussels he gave famous lecture in which he claimed enormous explosions take place in galactic nuclei and as result huge amount of mass is expelled
in addition if this is so these galactic nuclei must contain bodies of huge mass and unknown nature
ambartsumian report essentially introduced active galactic nucleus agn as major theory of galactic evolution
the concept of agn was widely accepted some years later
astronomy from space ambartsumian was pioneer of astronomical research from soviet spacecraft
the program was directed by his disciple grigor gurzadyan and was launched in in april the salyut space station carried orion the first space telescope with an objective prism into orbit
in december the manned soyuz mission operated the orion ultraviolet cassegrain telescope with quartz objective prism built in the byurakan observatory
spectra of thousands of stars to as faint as thirteenth magnitude were obtained as was the first satellite ultraviolet spectrogram of planetary nebula revealing lines of aluminium and titanium elements not previously observed in planetary nebulae
these activities especially the space missions when for example special manned spaceship had to be devoted to an experiment from the smallest soviet republic needed powerful backing both in kremlin corridors and within the top secret rocket industry establishment
this was achieved due to ambartsumian political skills with the active support of mstislav keldish the then president of the academy of sciences of the ussr
mathematics ambartsumian also made contributions to mathematics most notably with his paper in zeitschrift physik
in it ambartsumian first introduced the inverse sturm liouville problem
he proved that among all vibrating strings only the homogeneous vibrating string has eigenvalues that are specific to it that is homogeneous vibrating strings have spectrum of eigenvalues
it was only in the mid when his paper received attention and became significant research topic in the ensuing decades
he commented when an astronomer is publishing mathematical paper in physical journal he cannot expect to attract too many readers
science administration soviet academy of sciences ambartsumian was elected corresponding member of the ussr academy of sciences in and full member academician in in he became member of the academy presidium the governing body
he also chaired the academy joint coordinating scientific council on astronomy which was responsible for the priorities and all major decisions in all of astronomy
he was also chairman of the academy commissions on astronomy and cosmogony in these positions ambartsumian was one of the most powerful scientists of his time
mccutcheon noted that ambartsumian towering authority as an astrophysicist combined with his position in the soviet establishment made him arguably the most powerful soviet astronomer of his day
he was often the official head of soviet delegations at many conferences not only on astronomy but also on natural philosophy
from to ambartsumian was member of the editorial board of astronomicheskii zhurnal also known as astronomy reports the soviet union main astronomy journal
he was also on the editorial board of doklady akademii nauk sssr proceedings of the ussr academy of sciences
armenian academy of sciences although the armenian branch of the soviet academy of sciences was established in it was not until that the national academy of sciences of the armenian ssr was founded
ambartsumian was one of its original co founders along with other prominent scholars and scientists including hovsep orbeli who became its first president
ambartsumian initially served as vice president and in he became the academy second president serving for years until when he stepped down in he was declared honorary president of the academy rouben paul adalian wrote that ambartsumian exercised enormous influence in the advancement of science in soviet armenia and was revered as his country leading scientist
mccutcheon went on to note that from that point forward science in armenia was synonymous with the name ambartsumian
as president of the principal coordinating body for scientific research in soviet armenia ambartsumian played significant role in promoting the sciences in the country
he actively promoted the natural and exact sciences including physics and mathematics radioelectronics chemistry mechanics and engineering
artashes shahinian noted that ambartsumian played significant role in the development of the physical and mathematical sciences
he played an instrumental role in the establishment and development of the yerevan scientific research institute of mathematical machines yerniimm in popularly known as the mergelyan institute after its first director mathematician sergey mergelyan
apoyan rejects that ambartsumian had direct involvement in its creation and characterizes his role as favorable neutrality
overall apoyan criticizes ambartsumian role in science administration
he wrote that he had tendency to fail projects that did not directly serve his fame
he went as far as call ambartsumian role similar to that of tyrant
ambartsumian and mergelyan had complicated relationship
in ambartsumian persuaded him to return to armenia from moscow and become vice president of the armenian academy of sciences
however in mergelyan was not reelected to the presidium of the academy and was forced to leave it
some academicians called for revote but ambartsumian rejected any such attempts
oganjanyan and silantiev note that ambartsumian was rumored to have seen mergelyan as rival for the academy president and decided to get rid of the competitor forever
ambartsumian was the chairman of the editorial board of the armenian soviet encyclopedia haykakan sovetakan hanragitaran published in volumes in
supplementary volume devoted to soviet armenia was published in works on the encyclopedia began in although it reflected the government marxist leninist viewpoint is in the most comprehensive encyclopedia in the armenian language to this day
each volume was published in copies
international according to jean claude pecker ambartsumian had very strong influence on world astropolitics and is one of the few astronomers who have had such deep influence on the life of the international bodies devoted to the promotion and defense of astronomy and science in general
international astronomical unionambartsumian was member of the international astronomical union iau since he served as vice president of the iau from to then as president from to as vice president ambartsumian attempted to have the iau general assembly be held in leningrad in however the iau executive committee canceled the assembly increasing tensions within the iau
an iau general assembly eventually took place in moscow in ambartsumian headed the organizing committee
blaauw noted that during these years ambartsumian although violently opposing the iau policy remained loyal to the executive committee majority decisions for the sake of safeguarding international collaboration an attitude that contributed to his election as president of the iau in
he continued to support it as the world wide organization embracing astronomers from all countries
his election as president of the iau in reflected both the appreciation for his efforts in this respect and his outstanding scientific achievements
ambartsumian was outspoken about the importance of international cooperation
at the iau general assembly in rome he declared we believe that the joint study of such large problems as that of the evolution of celestial bodies will contribute to the cultural rapprochement of different nations and to better understanding among them
this is our modest contribution to the noble efforts toward maintaining peace throughout the world
at the iau symposium in sydney he stated that while competition between nations is important it should be associated with co operation
international council of scientific unionsambartsumian also served as president of the international council of scientific unions icsu between and being elected twice for two year terms in and he was the first individual from the eastern bloc to be elected to that post
philosophical and cosmological views ambartsumian published several books and articles on philosophy including philosophical questions about the science of the universe
in paper ambartsumian wrote that he believes in close collaboration of philosophy and the natural sciences to solve the main scientific problems about nature
ambartsumian became member of the administration of the philosophical society of the soviet union when it was established in in he became honorary president of the philosophical society of armenia which was created through his efforts
science and religion ambartsumian was an atheist and believed that science and religion are irreconcilable
ambartsumian wrote in for over four decades he headed gitelik the armenian branch of the all soviet organization znaniye knowledge founded in to continue the pre war atheist work of the league of militant godless
it published atheist novels and journals produced films and organized lectures on the supremacy of science over religion
the organization engaged in what it called scientific atheistic propaganda
despite his atheism ambartsumian reportedly felt that christianity has been important in preserving armenian identity
according to one associate ambartsumian self identified as an armenian christian but was not religious

marxism leninism and dialectical materialism ambartsumian accepted and followed marxist leninist philosophy and staunchly promoted dialectical materialism and projected it on his astrophysical interpretations
helge kragh described ambartsumian as convinced marxist
he wrote on marxism leninism and dialectical materialism in dialectical materialism influenced ambartsumian cosmological views and ideas
according to loren graham perhaps no great soviet scientist has made more outspoken statements in favor of dialectical materialism than ambartsumian
mark teeter wrote in report that ambartsumian is one of rather limited group of soviet scholars of international stature who claim that dialectical materialism has assisted them in their work
kragh noted that ambartsumian was not cosmologist but an astrophysicist and that his ideas of the universe were influenced both by his background in astrophysics and his adherence to marxist leninist philosophy
graham notes that his praise of dialectical materialism has been voiced again and again over the years these affirmations have come when political controls were rather lax as well as when they were tight
we have every reason to believe that they reflect at root his own approach to nature
political career and views ambartsumian is often referred to as politician donald lynden bell called him skillful one
in interview subrahmanyan chandrasekhar went as far as to opine that ambartsumian has been much more of politician than an astronomer since the mid lyudvig mirzoyan colleague and friend wrote that ambartsumian was true patriot of his native land soviet armenia and all the soviet union and simultaneously he was convinced internationalist
he was described by us based soviet government printed magazine as an ardent advocate of the widest possible international scientific exchange
soviet politics mccutcheon noted that ambartsumian life was shaped and directed by the soviet system and he was politically loyal to the soviet authorities
loren graham noted that at the same time ambartsumian was not afraid to reprimand the communist party ideologues when they obstructed his research
ronald doel noted that ambartsumian was in favor with the communist party and enjoyed the freedom to travel to the west
adriaan blaauw wrote that his political views harmonized to considerable degree with those of soviet rulers

in he was among leading soviet scientists who signed letter to president richard nixon in support of black militant communist angela davis and appealed him to give her an opportunity of continuing her scientific work
in ambartsumian was among soviet scientists who signed statement attacking president ronald reagan strategic defense initiative star wars namely reagan plan for an effective defense against nuclear attack
the scientists stated that reagan is creating most dangerous illusion that may turn into an even more threatening spiral of the arms race
ambartsumian relationship with dissidents was complicated
in he refused to meet yuri orlov nuclear physicist and prominent dissident after having offered him job in yerevan
ambartsumian told him through subordinate that there are situations when even an academy member is helpless
in he was among soviet scientists who denounced the award of the nobel peace prize to soviet physicist and dissident andrei sakharov
armenian causes ambartsumian revered the armenian language and supported its usage
he insisted all internal communication of the armenian academy of sciences be done in armenian when he became president in as president of the armenian academy of sciences ambartsumian often gave speeches at major events such as during the commemorations of the th anniversary of mesrop mashtots the inventor of the armenian alphabet in and the th anniversary of hovhannes tumanyan armenia national poet in
armenian genocide ambartsumian delivered speech on april on the th anniversary of the armenian genocide describing it as extermination of the armenian population of western armenia
he linked it to the th anniversary of soviet armenia and the revival of the armenian people as result of the october revolution
in an article published in pravda on april ambartsumian linked the armenian genocide to the holocaust and blamed german imperialism during world war for inspiring the young turks and the capitalist states for failing to defend the innocent armenian population and praised the october revolution for saving the armenian nation
nagorno karabakh in november the armenian academy of sciences led by ambartsumian issued statement protesting the decision of the supreme soviet of the soviet union to return nagorno karabakh to the direct jurisdiction of soviet azerbaijan in september ambartsumian and four other armenians including writer zori balayan and actor sos sargsyan went on hunger strike at the hotel moskva in moscow to protest the military rule over nagorno karabakh declared by mikhail gorbachev

this is bad thing when government does not abide by its own laws he argued
he also stated my desire is that karabakh be part of armenia
this is problem that has to be solved with long process and with concessions
ambartsumian stated that his only demand is that the elected leaders of nagorno karabakh regain control
ambartsumian called the hunger strike modest step aimed at making huge resonance in the world to let the world know
the soviet authorities totally ignored the strike
he ended it after days only when catholicos vazgen persuaded him to do so on may ambartsumian and number of members of the armenian academy of sciences wrote letter to soviet president mikhail gorbachev expressing their concern with the forced expulsion of ethnic armenians from parts of nkao and shahumian rayon as part of operation ring
soviet collapse and independence of armenia in june the session of the armenian academy of sciences issued statement on its views on armenian independence and the future of the soviet union
the academy stated its unconditional support for the independence of armenia pushed at the time by the pan armenian national movement hhsh
however it argued that because armenia is economically interconnected with and dependent on other soviet republics an abrupt disruption in the existing relations would result in unimaginable levels of economic collapse unemployment and emigration
thus they called for armenia to join the new union treaty proposed by gorbachev
the session also argued that leaving the soviet union would mean to abandon nagorno karabakh as communist ambartsumian reportedly regretted the collapse of the soviet union but voted for armenia independence in the referendum
he appreciated independent armenia but reminded armenians that they will be paying high price for it
in he congratulated armenians worldwide with armenia independence and stated that the newly independent republic is moving forward
according to yuri shahbazyan friend and biographer of ambartsumian he remained sympathetic towards the communist party of russia and was critical of western sponsored economic liberalization in russia and other post soviet countries
personal life when ambartsumian was referred to by foreigners as russian scientist he corrected them by saying he was armenian
he spoke perfect armenian albeit with an accent between and ambartsumian mostly divided his time between yerevan and byurakan
he built himself house within the byurakan observatory with the award money that came with his second stalin prize in since he also maintained house next to the building of the academy of sciences in yerevan on baghramyan avenue

recognition ambartsumian was one of the leading astrophysicists and astronomers of the th century
in subrahmanyan chandrasekhar stated my own impression has always been that he was when he was in his prime one of the most perceptive and elegant of astronomers
chandrasekhar wrote in ambartsumian was arguably the leading astronomer of the soviet union and is universally recognized as the founder of the soviet school of theoretical astrophysics
he was also well regarded internationally
loren graham called him one of the best known abroad of all soviet scientists
he was an honorary or foreign member of academies of sciences of over countries despite being soviet scientist he was well regarded in the united states
during the cold war ambartsumian was the first soviet scientist to become foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences and foreign associate of the national academy of sciences in and respectively
in january ambartsumian was invited to the house committee on science and astronautics where he was introduced by fred lawrence whipple as man who is rated the world greatest astronomer or at least among the very greatest

new york springer verlag
working time is the period of time that person spends at paid labor
unpaid labor such as personal housework or caring for children or pets is not considered part of the working week
many countries regulate the work week by law such as stipulating minimum daily rest periods annual holidays and maximum number of working hours per week
working time may vary from person to person often depending on economic conditions location culture lifestyle choice and the profitability of the individual livelihood
for example someone who is supporting children and paying large mortgage might need to work more hours to meet basic costs of living than someone of the same earning power with lower housing costs
in developed countries like the united kingdom some workers are part time because they are unable to find full time work but many choose reduced work hours to care for children or other family some choose it simply to increase leisure time standard working hours or normal working hours refers to the legislation to limit the working hours per day per week per month or per year
the employer pays higher rates for overtime hours as required in the law
standard working hours of countries worldwide are around to hours per week but not everywhere from hours per week in france to up to hours per week in north korean labor camps and the additional overtime payments are around to above the normal hourly payments
maximum working hours refers to the maximum working hours of an employee
the employee cannot work more than the level specified in the maximum working hours law the world health organization and the international labour organization estimated that globally in one in ten workers were exposed to working or more hours per week and persons died as result of having heart disease event or stroke attributable to having worked these long hours making exposure to long working hours the occupational risk factor with the largest disease burden
hunter gatherer since the the consensus among anthropologists historians and sociologists has been that early hunter gatherer societies enjoyed more leisure time than is permitted by capitalist and agrarian societies for instance one camp of kung bushmen was estimated to work two and half days per week at around hours day
aggregated comparisons show that on average the working day was less than five hours subsequent studies in the examined the machiguenga of the upper amazon and the kayapo of northern brazil
these studies expanded the definition of work beyond purely hunting gathering activities but the overall average across the hunter gatherer societies he studied was still below hours while the maximum was below hours
popular perception is still aligned with the old academic consensus that hunter gatherers worked far in excess of modern humans forty hour week
history the industrial revolution made it possible for larger segment of the population to work year round because this labor was not tied to the season and artificial lighting made it possible to work longer each day
peasants and farm laborers moved from rural areas to work in urban factories and working time during the year increased significantly
before collective bargaining and worker protection laws there was financial incentive for company to maximize the return on expensive machinery by having long hours
records indicate that work schedules as long as twelve to sixteen hours per day six to seven days per week were practiced in some industrial sites
over the th century work hours shortened by almost half partly due to rising wages brought about by renewed economic growth and competition for skilled workers with supporting role from trade unions collective bargaining and progressive legislation
the workweek in most of the industrialized world dropped steadily to about hours after world war ii
the limitation of working hours is also proclaimed by the universal declaration of human rights international covenant on economic social and cultural rights and european social charter
the decline continued at faster pace in europe for example france adopted hour workweek in in china adopted hour week eliminating half day work on saturdays though this is not widely practiced
working hours in industrializing economies like south korea though still much higher than the leading industrial countries are also declining steadily
technology has also continued to improve worker productivity permitting standards of living to rise as hours decline
in developed economies as the time needed to manufacture goods has declined more working hours have become available to provide services resulting in shift of much of the workforce between sectors
economic growth in monetary terms tends to be concentrated in health care education government criminal justice corrections and other activities rather than those that contribute directly to the production of material goods in the mid the netherlands was the first country in the industrialized world where the overall average working week dropped to less than hours
gradual decrease most countries in the developed world have seen average hours worked decrease significantly
for example in the in the late th century it was estimated that the average work week was over hours per week
today the average hours worked in the is around with the average man employed full time for hours per work day and the average woman employed full time for hours per work day
the front runners for lowest average weekly work hours are the netherlands with hours and france with hours
in report of oecd countries germany had the lowest average working hours per week at hours the new economics foundation has recommended moving to hour standard work week to address problems with unemployment high carbon emissions low well being entrenched inequalities overworking family care and the general lack of free time
actual work week lengths have been falling in the developed world factors that have contributed to lowering average work hours and increasing standard of living have been technological advances in efficiency such as mechanization robotics and information technology
the increase of women equally participating in making income as opposed to previously being commonly bound to homemaking and childrearing exclusively
dropping fertility rates leading to fewer hours needed to be worked to support children recent articles supporting four day week have argued that reduced work hours would increase consumption and invigorate the economy
however other articles state that consumption would decrease which could reduce the environmental impact
other arguments for the four day week include improvements to workers level of education due to having extra time to take classes and courses and improvements to workers health less work related stress and extra time for exercise
reduced hours also save money on day care costs and transportation which in turn helps the environment with less carbon related emissions
these benefits increase workforce productivity on per hour basis
workweek structure the structure of the work week varies considerably for different professions and cultures
among salaried workers in the western world the work week often consists of monday to friday or saturday with the weekend set aside as time of personal work and leisure
sunday is set aside in the western world because it is the christian sabbath
the traditional american business hours are to monday to friday representing workweek of five eight hour days comprising hours in total
these are the origin of the phrase to used to describe conventional and possibly tedious job
negatively used it connotes tedious or unremarkable occupation
the phrase also indicates that person is an employee usually in large company rather than an entrepreneur or self employed
more neutrally it connotes job with stable hours and low career risk but still position of subordinate employment
the actual time at work often varies between and hours in practice due to the inclusion or lack of inclusion of breaks
in many traditional white collar positions employees were required to be in the office during these hours to take orders from the bosses hence the relationship between this phrase and subordination
workplace hours have become more flexible but the phrase is still commonly used even in situations where the term does not apply literally
average annual hours per worker oecd ranking trends over time by region europe in most european union countries working time is gradually decreasing
the european union working time directive imposes hour maximum working week that applies to every member state except malta which have an opt out meaning that employees in malta may work longer than hours if they wish but they cannot be forced to do so
major reason for the lower annual hours worked in europe is relatively high amount of paid annual leave
fixed employment comes with four to six weeks of holiday as standard
france france experimented in with sharp cut of legal or statutory working time of the employees in the private and public sector from hours week to hours week with the stated goal to fight against rampant unemployment at that time
the law on working time reduction is also referred to as the aubry law according to the name of the labor minister at that time
employees may and do work more than hours week yet in this case firms must pay them overtime bonuses
if the bonus is determined through collective negotiations it cannot be lower than
if no agreement on working time is signed the legal bonus must be of for the first hours then goes up to for the rest
including overtime the maximum working time cannot exceed hours per week and should not exceed hours per week over weeks in row
in france the labor law also regulates the minimum working hours part time jobs should not allow for less than hours per week without branch collective agreement
these agreements can allow for less under tight conditions
according to the official statistics dares after the introduction of the law on working time reduction actual hours per week performed by full time employed fell from hours in to trough of hours in then gradually went back to hours in in working hours were of
south korea south korea has the fastest shortening working time in the oecd which is the result of the government proactive move to lower working hours at all levels and to increase leisure and relaxation time which introduced the mandatory forty hour five day working week in for companies with over employees
beyond regular working hours it is legal to demand up to hours of overtime during the week plus another hours on weekends
the hour workweek expanded to companies with employees or more in employees or more in or more in or more in and full inclusion to all workers nationwide in july the government has continuously increased public holidays to days in more than the days of the united states and double that of the united kingdom days
despite those efforts south korea work hours are still relatively long with an average hours per year in
japan work hours in japan are decreasing but many japanese still work long hours
recently japan ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw issued draft report recommending major changes to the regulations that govern working hours
the centerpiece of the proposal is an exemption from overtime pay for white collar workers
japan has enacted an hour work day and hour work week hours in specified workplaces
the overtime limits are hours week hours over two weeks hours over four weeks hours month hours over two months and hours over three months however some workers get around these restrictions by working several hours day without clocking in whether physically or metaphorically
the overtime allowance should not be lower than and not more than of the normal hourly rate
workaholism in japan is considered serious social problem leading to early death phenomenon dubbed kar shi meaning death from overwork
mexico mexican laws mandate maximum of hours of work per week but they are rarely observed or enforced due to loopholes in the law the volatility of labor rights in mexico and its underdevelopment relative to other members countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd
indeed private sector employees often work overtime without receiving overtime compensation
fear of unemployment and threats by employers explain in part why the hour work week is disregarded
colombia articles to of the substantive work code in colombia provide for maximum of hours of work week
also the law notes that workdays should be divided into sections to allow break usually given as the meal time which is not counted as work
typically there is hours break for lunch that starts from through in june the colombian congress approved bill for the reduction of the work week from to hours which will be implemented in several stages from to
spain the main labor law in spain the workers statute act limits the amount of working time that an employee is obliged to perform
in the article of this law maximum of hours per day and hours per week are established employees typically receive either or payments per year with approximately days of vacation
according to spanish law spain holds what is known as the convenios colectivos which stipulates that different regulations and laws regarding employee work week and wage apply based on the type of job
overall they rank as the th highest in regard to international gdp growth according to study of the oecd better life index of spanish workers work more than hours per week compared to an average of of workers in oecd countries working hours are regulated by law
mandatory logging of employee working time has been in place since in an attempt by legislators to eliminate unpaid overtime and push for more transparency of actual working hours
non regulated pauses during the workday for coffee or smoking are not permitted to be documented as working time according to ruling by the spanish national court in february
traditional mid day break however one of the interesting aspects of the spanish work day and labor is the traditional presence of break around lunchtime
it is sometimes mistakenly thought to be due to siesta but in fact was due to workers returning to their families for the main midday meal
that break typically of or hours has been kept in the working culture because in the post civil war period most workers had two jobs to be able to sustain their families
following this tradition in small and medium sized cities restaurants and businesses shut down during this time period of for retail and for restaurants
many office jobs only allow one hour or even half hour breaks to eat the meal in office building restaurants or designated lunch rooms
majority of adults emphasize the lack of siesta during the typical work week
only one in ten spaniards take mid day nap percentage less than other european nations
australia in australia between and no marked change took place in the average amount of time spent at work by australians of prime working age that is between and years of age
throughout this period the average time spent at work by prime working age australians including those who did not spend any time at work remained stable at between and hours per week
this unchanging average however masks significant redistribution of work from men to women
between and the average time spent at work by prime working age australian men fell from to hours per week while the average time spent at work by prime working age australian women rose from to hours per week
in the period leading up to the amount of time australian workers spent at work outside the hours of to on weekdays also increased in rapid increase in the number of working hours was reported in study by the australia institute
the study found the average australian worked hours per year at work
according to clive hamilton of the australia institute this surpasses even japan
the australia institute believes that australians work the highest number of hours in the developed world the hour working week was introduced in the vast majority of full time employees in australia work additional overtime hours
survey found that of australia million full time workers million put in more than hours week including million who worked more than hours week and who put in more than hours
united states in the average man employed full time worked hours per work day and the average woman employed full time worked hours per work day
there is no mandatory minimum amount of paid time off for sickness or holiday but the majority of full time civilian workers have access to paid vacation time
by the united states government had inaugurated the hour work week for all federal employees
beginning in under the truman administration the united states became the first known industrialized nation to explicitly albeit secretly and permanently forswear reduction of working time
given the military industrial requirements of the cold war the authors of the then secret national security council report nsc proposed the us government undertake massive permanent national economic expansion that would let it siphon off part of the economic activity produced to support an ongoing military buildup to contain the soviet union
in his annual message to the congress president truman stated in terms of manpower our present defense targets will require an increase of nearly one million men and women in the armed forces within few months and probably not less than four million more in defense production by the end of the year
this means that an additional percent of our labor force and possibly much more will be required by direct defense needs by the end of the year
these manpower needs will call both for increasing our labor force by reducing unemployment and drawing in women and older workers and for lengthening hours of work in essential industries
according to the bureau of labor statistics the average non farm private sector employee worked hours per week as of june as president truman message had predicted the share of working women rose from percent of the labor force in to percent by growing at particularly rapid rate during the
according to bureau of labor statistics report issued may in the overall participation rate of women was percent
the rate rose to percent in percent in percent in and percent in and reached percent by the overall labor force participation rate of women is projected to attain its highest level in at percent
the inclusion of women in the work force can be seen as symbolic of social progress as well as of increasing american productivity and hours worked
between and official price inflation was measured to percent
president truman in his message to congress predicted correctly that his military buildup will cause intense and mounting inflationary pressures
using the data provided by the united states bureau of labor statistics erik rauch has estimated productivity to have increased by nearly
according to rauch if productivity means anything at all worker should be able to earn the same standard of living as worker in only hours per week
in the united states the working time for upper income professionals has increased compared to while total annual working time for low skill low income workers has decreased
this effect is sometimes called the leisure gap
the average working time of married couples of both spouses taken together rose from hours in to hours in
overtime rules many professional workers put in longer hours than the forty hour standard
in professional industries like investment banking and large law firms forty hour workweek is considered inadequate and may result in job loss or failure to be promoted
medical residents in the united states routinely work long hours as part of their training
workweek policies are not uniform in the many compensation arrangements are legal and three of the most common are wage commission and salary payment schemes
wage earners are compensated on per hour basis whereas salaried workers are compensated on per week or per job basis and commission workers get paid according to how much they produce or sell
under most circumstances wage earners and lower level employees may be legally required by an employer to work more than forty hours in week however they are paid extra for the additional work
many salaried workers and commission paid sales staff are not covered by overtime laws
these are generally called exempt positions because they are exempt from federal and state laws that mandate extra pay for extra time worked
the rules are complex but generally exempt workers are executives professionals or sales staff
for example school teachers are not paid extra for working extra hours
business owners and independent contractors are considered self employed and none of these laws apply to them
generally workers are paid time and half or times the worker base wage for each hour of work past forty
california also applies this rule to work in excess of eight hours per day but exemptions and exceptions significantly limit the applicability of this law
in some states firms are required to pay double time or twice the base rate for each hour of work past or each hour of work past in one day in california also subject to numerous exemptions and exceptions
this provides an incentive for companies to limit working time but makes these additional hours more desirable for the worker
it is not uncommon for overtime hours to be accepted voluntarily by wage earning workers
unions often treat overtime as desirable commodity when negotiating how these opportunities shall be partitioned among union members
brazil brazil has hour work week normally hours per day and hours on saturday or hours per day
jobs with no meal breaks or on duty meal breaks are hours per day
public servants work hours per week
lunch breaks are one hour and are not usually counted as work
typical work schedule is or in larger cities workers eat lunch on or near their work site while some workers in smaller cities may go home for lunch
day vacation is mandated by law
holidays vary by municipality with approximately to holidays per year
mainland china china adopted hour week eliminating half day work on saturdays
however this rule has never been truly enforced and unpaid or underpaid overtime working is common practice in china traditionally chinese have worked long hours and this has led to many deaths from overwork with the state media reporting in that people were dying suddenly annually some of them were dying from overwork
despite this work hours have reportedly been falling for about three decades due to rising productivity better labor laws and the spread of the two day weekend
the trend has affected both factories and white collar companies that have been responding to growing demands for easier work schedules
the working hour system as it is known is where employees work from to six days week excluding two hours of lunch nap during the noon and one hour of supper in the evening
alibaba founder jack yun ma and jd com founder richard qiangdong liu both praise the schedule saying such schedule has helped chinese tech giants like alibaba and tencent grow to become what they are today
hong kong hong kong has no legislation regarding maximum and normal working hours
the average weekly working hours of full time employees in hong kong is hours
according to the price and earnings report conducted by ubs while the global and regional average were and hours per year respectively the average working hours in hong kong is hours per year which ranked the fifth longest yearly working hours among countries under study
in addition from the survey conducted by the public opinion study group of the university of hong kong of the respondents agree that the problem of overtime work in hong kong is severe and of the respondents support the legislation on the maximum working hours
in hong kong of surveyed do not receive any overtime remuneration
these show that people in hong kong concerns the working time issues
as hong kong implemented the minimum wage law in may the chief executive donald tsang of the special administrative region pledged that the government will standardize working hours in hong kong on november the labour department of the hksar released the report of the policy study on standard working hours
the report covers three major areas including the regimes and experience of other places in regulating working hours latest working time situations of employees in different sectors and estimation of the possible impact of introducing standard working hour in hong kong
under the selected parameters from most loosen to most stringent the estimated increase in labour cost vary from billion to billion hkd and affect of total employees to of total employees various sectors of the community show concerns about the standard working hours in hong kong
the points are summarized as below labor organizations hong kong catholic commission for labour affairs urges the government to legislate the standard working hours in hong kong and suggests hours standard hours maximum working hours in week
the organization thinks that long working time adversely affects the family and social life and health of employees it also indicates that the current employment ordinance does not regulate overtime pays working time limits nor rest day pays which can protect employees rights
businesses and related organizations generally business sector agrees that it is important to achieve work life balance but does not support legislation to regulate working hours limit

working time is the period of time that person spends at paid labor
unpaid labor such as personal housework or caring for children or pets is not considered part of the working week
many countries regulate the work week by law such as stipulating minimum daily rest periods annual holidays and maximum number of working hours per week
working time may vary from person to person often depending on economic conditions location culture lifestyle choice and the profitability of the individual livelihood
for example someone who is supporting children and paying large mortgage might need to work more hours to meet basic costs of living than someone of the same earning power with lower housing costs
in developed countries like the united kingdom some workers are part time because they are unable to find full time work but many choose reduced work hours to care for children or other family some choose it simply to increase leisure time standard working hours or normal working hours refers to the legislation to limit the working hours per day per week per month or per year
the employer pays higher rates for overtime hours as required in the law
standard working hours of countries worldwide are around to hours per week but not everywhere from hours per week in france to up to hours per week in north korean labor camps and the additional overtime payments are around to above the normal hourly payments
maximum working hours refers to the maximum working hours of an employee
the employee cannot work more than the level specified in the maximum working hours law the world health organization and the international labour organization estimated that globally in one in ten workers were exposed to working or more hours per week and persons died as result of having heart disease event or stroke attributable to having worked these long hours making exposure to long working hours the occupational risk factor with the largest disease burden
hunter gatherer since the the consensus among anthropologists historians and sociologists has been that early hunter gatherer societies enjoyed more leisure time than is permitted by capitalist and agrarian societies for instance one camp of kung bushmen was estimated to work two and half days per week at around hours day
aggregated comparisons show that on average the working day was less than five hours subsequent studies in the examined the machiguenga of the upper amazon and the kayapo of northern brazil
these studies expanded the definition of work beyond purely hunting gathering activities but the overall average across the hunter gatherer societies he studied was still below hours while the maximum was below hours
popular perception is still aligned with the old academic consensus that hunter gatherers worked far in excess of modern humans forty hour week
history the industrial revolution made it possible for larger segment of the population to work year round because this labor was not tied to the season and artificial lighting made it possible to work longer each day
peasants and farm laborers moved from rural areas to work in urban factories and working time during the year increased significantly
before collective bargaining and worker protection laws there was financial incentive for company to maximize the return on expensive machinery by having long hours
records indicate that work schedules as long as twelve to sixteen hours per day six to seven days per week were practiced in some industrial sites
over the th century work hours shortened by almost half partly due to rising wages brought about by renewed economic growth and competition for skilled workers with supporting role from trade unions collective bargaining and progressive legislation
the workweek in most of the industrialized world dropped steadily to about hours after world war ii
the limitation of working hours is also proclaimed by the universal declaration of human rights international covenant on economic social and cultural rights and european social charter
the decline continued at faster pace in europe for example france adopted hour workweek in in china adopted hour week eliminating half day work on saturdays though this is not widely practiced
working hours in industrializing economies like south korea though still much higher than the leading industrial countries are also declining steadily
technology has also continued to improve worker productivity permitting standards of living to rise as hours decline
in developed economies as the time needed to manufacture goods has declined more working hours have become available to provide services resulting in shift of much of the workforce between sectors
economic growth in monetary terms tends to be concentrated in health care education government criminal justice corrections and other activities rather than those that contribute directly to the production of material goods in the mid the netherlands was the first country in the industrialized world where the overall average working week dropped to less than hours
gradual decrease most countries in the developed world have seen average hours worked decrease significantly
for example in the in the late th century it was estimated that the average work week was over hours per week
today the average hours worked in the is around with the average man employed full time for hours per work day and the average woman employed full time for hours per work day
the front runners for lowest average weekly work hours are the netherlands with hours and france with hours
in report of oecd countries germany had the lowest average working hours per week at hours the new economics foundation has recommended moving to hour standard work week to address problems with unemployment high carbon emissions low well being entrenched inequalities overworking family care and the general lack of free time
actual work week lengths have been falling in the developed world factors that have contributed to lowering average work hours and increasing standard of living have been technological advances in efficiency such as mechanization robotics and information technology
the increase of women equally participating in making income as opposed to previously being commonly bound to homemaking and childrearing exclusively
dropping fertility rates leading to fewer hours needed to be worked to support children recent articles supporting four day week have argued that reduced work hours would increase consumption and invigorate the economy
however other articles state that consumption would decrease which could reduce the environmental impact
other arguments for the four day week include improvements to workers level of education due to having extra time to take classes and courses and improvements to workers health less work related stress and extra time for exercise
reduced hours also save money on day care costs and transportation which in turn helps the environment with less carbon related emissions
these benefits increase workforce productivity on per hour basis
workweek structure the structure of the work week varies considerably for different professions and cultures
among salaried workers in the western world the work week often consists of monday to friday or saturday with the weekend set aside as time of personal work and leisure

these are the origin of the phrase to used to describe conventional and possibly tedious job
negatively used it connotes tedious or unremarkable occupation

more neutrally it connotes job with stable hours and low career risk but still position of subordinate employment
the actual time at work often varies between and hours in practice due to the inclusion or lack of inclusion of breaks
in many traditional white collar positions employees were required to be in the office during these hours to take orders from the bosses hence the relationship between this phrase and subordination
workplace hours have become more flexible but the phrase is still commonly used even in situations where the term does not apply literally

by the united states government had inaugurated the hour work week for all federal employees
beginning in under the truman administration the united states became the first known industrialized nation to explicitly albeit secretly and permanently forswear reduction of working time
given the military industrial requirements of the cold war the authors of the then secret national security council report nsc proposed the us government undertake massive permanent national economic expansion that would let it siphon off part of the economic activity produced to support an ongoing military buildup to contain the soviet union
in his annual message to the congress president truman stated in terms of manpower our present defense targets will require an increase of nearly one million men and women in the armed forces within few months and probably not less than four million more in defense production by the end of the year
this means that an additional percent of our labor force and possibly much more will be required by direct defense needs by the end of the year
these manpower needs will call both for increasing our labor force by reducing unemployment and drawing in women and older workers and for lengthening hours of work in essential industries
according to the bureau of labor statistics the average non farm private sector employee worked hours per week as of june as president truman message had predicted the share of working women rose from percent of the labor force in to percent by growing at particularly rapid rate during the

workweek policies are not uniform in the many compensation arrangements are legal and three of the most common are wage commission and salary payment schemes
wage earners are compensated on per hour basis whereas salaried workers are compensated on per week or per job basis and commission workers get paid according to how much they produce or sell
under most circumstances wage earners and lower level employees may be legally required by an employer to work more than forty hours in week however they are paid extra for the additional work
many salaried workers and commission paid sales staff are not covered by overtime laws
these are generally called exempt positions because they are exempt from federal and state laws that mandate extra pay for extra time worked
the rules are complex but generally exempt workers are executives professionals or sales staff
for example school teachers are not paid extra for working extra hours
business owners and independent contractors are considered self employed and none of these laws apply to them
generally workers are paid time and half or times the worker base wage for each hour of work past forty
california also applies this rule to work in excess of eight hours per day but exemptions and exceptions significantly limit the applicability of this law
in some states firms are required to pay double time or twice the base rate for each hour of work past or each hour of work past in one day in california also subject to numerous exemptions and exceptions
this provides an incentive for companies to limit working time but makes these additional hours more desirable for the worker
it is not uncommon for overtime hours to be accepted voluntarily by wage earning workers
unions often treat overtime as desirable commodity when negotiating how these opportunities shall be partitioned among union members

conceptual framework is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts
it can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed
it is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas
strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in way that is easy to remember and apply
isaiah berlin used the metaphor of fox and hedgehog to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world
berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use single idea or organizing principle to view the world such as dante alighieri blaise pascal fyodor dostoyevsky plato henrik ibsen and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel
foxes on the other hand incorporate type of pluralism and view the world through multiple sometimes conflicting lenses examples include johann wolfgang von goethe james joyce william shakespeare aristotle herodotus moli re and honor de balzac
economists use the conceptual framework of supply and demand to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers
like many conceptual frameworks supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations see demand curve
both political science and economics use principal agent theory as conceptual framework
the politics administration dichotomy is long standing conceptual framework used in public administration
all three of these cases are examples of macro level conceptual framework
overview the use of the term conceptual framework crosses both scale large and small theories and contexts social science marketing applied science art etc
its explicit definition and application can therefore vary
conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research
one set of scholars has applied the notion of conceptual framework to deductive empirical research at the micro or individual study level
they employ american football plays as useful metaphor to clarify the meaning of conceptual framework used in the context of deductive empirical study
likewise conceptual frameworks are abstract representations connected to the research project goal that direct the collection and analysis of data on the plane of observation the ground
critically football play is plan of action tied to particular timely purpose usually summarized as long or short yardage
shields and rangarajan argue that it is this tie to purpose that make american football plays such good metaphor
they define conceptual framework as the way ideas are organized to achieve research project purpose
like football plays conceptual frameworks are connected to research purpose or aim
explanation is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research
the formal hypothesis of scientific investigation is the framework associated with explanation explanatory research usually focuses on why or what caused phenomenon to occur
formal hypotheses posit possible explanations answers to the why question that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence usually quantitative using statistical tests
for example kai huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in cities
three factors were posited to influence residential fires
these factors environment population and building characteristics became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose explain factors that influenced home fires in cities
types several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified and line up with research purpose in the following ways working hypothesis exploration or exploratory research pillar questions exploration or exploratory research descriptive categories description or descriptive research practical ideal type analysis gauging models of operations research decision making formal hypothesis explanation and predictionnote that shields and rangarajan do not claim that the above are the only framework purpose pairing
nor do they claim the system is applicable to inductive forms of empirical research
rather the conceptual framework research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars point of departure to develop their own research design frameworks have also been used to explain conflict theory and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution
within these conflict frameworks visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance
boundaries form and within these boundaries tensions regarding laws and chaos or freedom are mitigated
these frameworks often function like cells with sub frameworks stasis evolution and revolution
anomalies may exist without adequate lenses or filters to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them

the episode aired on nbc in the united states on february
after hours was written by co executive producers halsted sullivan and warren lieberstein and directed by brian baumgartner who portrays kevin malone on the series marking his directorial debut
the series presented as if it were real documentary depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the scranton pennsylvania branch of the fictional dunder mifflin paper company
in the episode dwight schrute rainn wilson and todd packer david koechner compete for job
meanwhile jim halpert john krasinski has to deal with cathy sexual advances in his hotel room
also andy bernard ed helms has everyone stay late to cover for their co workers in florida
after hours received mixed reviews from critics
according to the nielsen media research after hours was viewed by an estimated million viewers and received rating share among adults between the ages of and marking rise in the ratings from the series low ratings of the previous episode tallahassee
the episode also ranked as the highest rated nbc program of the night
synopsis dwight schrute rainn wilson and todd packer david koechner compete to become vp under nellie bertram catherine tate by seducing her after work at the hotel bar
for most of the night packer seems to be the most successful so dwight has gabe lewis zach woods keep nellie distracted while dwight helps jim halpert john krasinski with something in his hotel room
gabe takes it upon himself to spike packer beer with his asthma inhaler which causes packer to vomit on gabe pants and leaves dwight alone with nellie
dwight eventually succeeds in seducing nellie as she asks for key to his room
upon kissing her and realizing that what he is doing is wrong dwight secretly scratches off the magnetic strip on his hotel card before giving it to nellie stating the seduction was only to gain approval
in scranton andy bernard ed helms has everyone stay late to cover for their co workers in florida which turns into an awkward situation when val ameenah kaplan boyfriend brandon jerry minor arrives with jamaican food andy ordered and accuses darryl philbin craig robinson of having an affair with her after having read darryl text messages to her
kelly kapoor mindy kaling demands that darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest
upon hearing them most of the staff agree that his text messages particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one are suggestive of darryl wanting to be with val
val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with darryl is ridiculous
pam halpert jenna fischer and andy each advise darryl on what jim would do while andy suggest he wait pam says that if jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged she never would have ended up marrying him
darryl follows pam advice and tells val that potential relationship is not ridiculous
erin hannon ellie kemper confides in ryan howard novak that she is intending to stay in tallahassee
ryan interprets this as an invitation to hook up with her so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make waffle she unsuccessfully ordered
they hide under table when the chefs return
after ryan compliments erin she suggests that they could become roommates in florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them
not wanting that long timeline he begrudgingly resorts to saying he loves kelly
jim has started spending more time with cathy simms lindsey broad because stanley hudson leslie david baker keeps trying to rope jim into having an affair
during the night at the hotel cathy asks to hang out for while in jim room under the pretext that the heat in her room is malfunctioning
she repeatedly makes seductive signals making jim uncomfortable
stanley is no help so he calls dwight saying he has bed bugs
fearing that the bugs will transfer onto dwight himself dwight arrives and forces cathy off jim bed so he can lure out the bed bugs with his nearly naked body
this fails to sufficiently disgust cathy who merely steps into the bathroom to take shower until dwight leaves
cathy gets out of the shower wearing only bath robe
after ordering some desserts from room service and asking jim to touch her legs he finally comes out saying that he is happily married and does not want to be with her
cathy gets defensive and insists that she did not have any romantic intentions whatsoever so jim relents but cathy immediately resumes her seductive technique
after jim goes to the bathroom he comes out to find her in only her underwear under his blanket
fed up he demands that she leave and lets dwight armed with spray chemicals into the room
jim claims to see bed bug near cathy making her flee from dwight spraying
however because of the chemicals dwight suggests jim sleep in cathy room
jim instead spends the night with dwight in his room eating cathy desserts and watching tv while drunken nellie tries unsuccessfully to get in
production after hours was written by co executive producers halsted sullivan and warren lieberstein
it was directed by brian baumgartner who portrays kevin malone on the series marking his directorial debut
the episode features guest appearance from david koechner who appears as todd packer in the series
he recently made deal with nbc to do more episodes for the series and also possibly join the cast of series developer greg daniels next series friday night dinner an adaption of the british series of the same name
the episode marks the tenth appearance of lindsey broad who plays cathy pam replacement during her maternity leave
she appeared in recurring role for the season after she initially appeared in pam replacement
the season eight dvd contains number of deleted scenes from this episode
notable cut scenes include nellie establishing boundaries for flirtation nellie and dwight confessing peculiar secrets to each other and pam and andy calling jim for advice only to have cathy answer the phone
reception ratings after hours originally aired on nbc in the united states on february the episode was viewed by an estimated million viewers and received rating share among adults between the ages of and this means that it was seen by of all to year olds and of all to year olds watching television at the time of the broadcast
this marked percent rise in the ratings from the previous episode tallahassee
the episode finished third in its time slot being beaten by grey anatomy which received rating share and the cbs drama person of interest which received rating share in the demographic
the episode beat the cw drama series the secret circle and the fox drama series the finder
despite this after hours was the highest rated nbc television episode of the night
it was also the last episode of the office to be viewed by more than million viewers until the series finale year later
reviews after hours received mixed reviews from critics
hitfix writer alan sepinwall called it the best episode of disappointing season
he was mainly positive towards the focus of the episode with both story lines in tallahassee and scranton taken place after hours and for the several plot lines in the episode
he praised the pairing of darryl and val saying that they are better matched to be the series new jim and pam than andy and erin
cindy white of ign said that the episode proved the series was on hot streak
she mainly liked the storylines taking place in tallahassee and said that the end of the dwight nellie storyline was nice bit of character development
she was also very positive to baumgarter directing in the episode saying he nailed the documentary format of the episode
she went on to slightly criticize the scranton storyline and wrote that she hoped the writers would wait before putting val and darryl together
she ultimately gave the episode not all reviews were positive
club reviewer myles mcnutt wrote that the episode was too crowded and that while all four plotlines had potential they weren given enough time to develop
despite this he did compliment the dwight scenes due to their ability to gain comic rhythm
he also complimented the dwight nellie todd storyline saying that his decision to not sleep with nellie was nicely human moment and also wrote that the character was more grounded when he was more self aware
he ultimately gave the episode many critics commented on the plot featuring cathy attempting to seduce jim
white noted that jim did bumble it bit in the face of cathy taking insincere offense at his accusation but the outcome wasn hard to predict
of course jim would stay true to his real soulmate
sepinwall noted dwight cartoonish behavior in the episode although he called it good addition to the jim cathy story line
mcnutt wrote that due to the choppy storytelling the jim cathy storyline was not able to feel awkward enough to feel jim struggle

in linear algebra the singular value decomposition svd is factorization of real or complex matrix
it generalizes the eigendecomposition of square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any matrix
it is related to the polar decomposition
specifically the singular value decomposition of an complex matrix is factorization of the form where is an complex unitary matrix is an rectangular diagonal matrix with non negative real numbers on the diagonal is an complex unitary matrix and is the conjugate transpose of such decomposition always exists for any complex matrix
if is real then and can be guaranteed to be real orthogonal matrices in such contexts the svd is often denoted the diagonal entries of are uniquely determined by and are known as the singular values of the number of non zero singular values is equal to the rank of the columns of and the columns of are called left singular vectors and right singular vectors of respectively
they form two sets of orthonormal bases um and vn and if they are sorted so that the singular values with value zero are all in the highest numbered columns or rows the singular value decomposition can be written as where min is the rank of the svd is not unique
it is always possible to choose the decomposition so that the singular values are in descending order
in this case but not and is uniquely determined by the term sometimes refers to the compact svd similar decomposition in which is square diagonal of size where min is the rank of and has only the non zero singular values
in this variant is an semi unitary matrix and is an semi unitary matrix such that mathematical applications of the svd include computing the pseudoinverse matrix approximation and determining the rank range and null space of matrix
the svd is also extremely useful in all areas of science engineering and statistics such as signal processing least squares fitting of data and process control
intuitive interpretations rotation coordinate scaling and reflection in the special case when is an real square matrix the matrices and can be chosen to be real matrices too
in that case unitary is the same as orthogonal
then interpreting both unitary matrices as well as the diagonal matrix summarized here as as linear transformation ax of the space rm the matrices and represent rotations or reflection of the space while represents the scaling of each coordinate xi by the factor
thus the svd decomposition breaks down any linear transformation of rm into composition of three geometrical transformations rotation or reflection followed by coordinate by coordinate scaling followed by another rotation or reflection
in particular if has positive determinant then and can be chosen to be both rotations with reflections or both rotations without reflections
if the determinant is negative exactly one of them will have reflection
if the determinant is zero each can be independently chosen to be of either type
if the matrix is real but not square namely with it can be interpreted as linear transformation from rn to rm
then and can be chosen to be rotations reflections of rm and rn respectively and besides scaling the first min coordinates also extends the vector with zeros
removes trailing coordinates so as to turn rn into rm
singular values as semiaxes of an ellipse or ellipsoid as shown in the figure the singular values can be interpreted as the magnitude of the semiaxes of an ellipse in
this concept can be generalized to dimensional euclidean space with the singular values of any square matrix being viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an dimensional ellipsoid
similarly the singular values of any matrix can be viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an dimensional ellipsoid in dimensional space for example as an ellipse in tilted plane in space
singular values encode magnitude of the semiaxis while singular vectors encode direction
see below for further details
the columns of and are orthonormal bases since and are unitary the columns of each of them form set of orthonormal vectors which can be regarded as basis vectors
the matrix maps the basis vector vi to the stretched unit vector ui
by the definition of unitary matrix the same is true for their conjugate transposes and except the geometric interpretation of the singular values as stretches is lost
in short the columns of and are orthonormal bases
when the is positive semidefinite hermitian matrix and are both equal to the unitary matrix used to diagonalize however when is not positive semidefinite and hermitian but still diagonalizable its eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition are distinct
geometric meaning because and are unitary we know that the columns um of yield an orthonormal basis of km and the columns vn of yield an orthonormal basis of kn with respect to the standard scalar products on these spaces
the linear transformation has particularly simple description with respect to these orthonormal bases we have min where is the th diagonal entry of and vi for min
the geometric content of the svd theorem can thus be summarized as follows for every linear map kn km one can find orthonormal bases of kn and km such that maps the th basis vector of kn to non negative multiple of the th basis vector of km and sends the left over basis vectors to zero
with respect to these bases the map is therefore represented by diagonal matrix with non negative real diagonal entries
to get more visual flavor of singular values and svd factorization at least when working on real vector spaces consider the sphere of radius one in rn
the linear map maps this sphere onto an ellipsoid in rm
non zero singular values are simply the lengths of the semi axes of this ellipsoid
especially when and all the singular values are distinct and non zero the svd of the linear map can be easily analyzed as succession of three consecutive moves consider the ellipsoid and specifically its axes then consider the directions in rn sent by onto these axes
these directions happen to be mutually orthogonal
apply first an isometry sending these directions to the coordinate axes of rn
on second move apply an endomorphism diagonalized along the coordinate axes and stretching or shrinking in each direction using the semi axes lengths of as stretching coefficients
the composition then sends the unit sphere onto an ellipsoid isometric to
to define the third and last move apply an isometry to this ellipsoid to obtain
as can be easily checked the composition coincides with example consider the matrix singular value decomposition of this matrix is given by the scaling matrix is zero outside of the diagonal grey italics and one diagonal element is zero red bold
furthermore because the matrices and are unitary multiplying by their respective conjugate transposes yields identity matrices as shown below
in this case because and are real valued each is an orthogonal matrix
this particular singular value decomposition is not unique
choosing such that is also valid singular value decomposition
svd and spectral decomposition singular values singular vectors and their relation to the svd non negative real number is singular value for if and only if there exist unit length vectors in km and in kn such that and the vectors and are called left singular and right singular vectors for respectively
in any singular value decomposition the diagonal entries of are equal to the singular values of the first min columns of and are respectively left and right singular vectors for the corresponding singular values
consequently the above theorem implies that an matrix has at most distinct singular values
it is always possible to find unitary basis for km with subset of basis vectors spanning the left singular vectors of each singular value of it is always possible to find unitary basis for kn with subset of basis vectors spanning the right singular vectors of each singular value of singular value for which we can find two left or right singular vectors that are linearly independent is called degenerate
if and are two left singular vectors which both correspond to the singular value then any normalized linear combination of the two vectors is also left singular vector corresponding to the singular value the similar statement is true for right singular vectors
the number of independent left and right singular vectors coincides and these singular vectors appear in the same columns of and corresponding to diagonal elements of all with the same value as an exception the left and right singular vectors of singular value comprise all unit vectors in the kernel and cokernel respectively of which by the rank nullity theorem cannot be the same dimension if even if all singular values are nonzero if then the cokernel is nontrivial in which case is padded with orthogonal vectors from the cokernel
conversely if then is padded by orthogonal vectors from the kernel
however if the singular value of exists the extra columns of or already appear as left or right singular vectors
non degenerate singular values always have unique left and right singular vectors up to multiplication by unit phase factor ei for the real case up to sign
consequently if all singular values of square matrix are non degenerate and non zero then its singular value decomposition is unique up to multiplication of column of by unit phase factor and simultaneous multiplication of the corresponding column of by the same unit phase factor
in general the svd is unique up to arbitrary unitary transformations applied uniformly to the column vectors of both and spanning the subspaces of each singular value and up to arbitrary unitary transformations on vectors of and spanning the kernel and cokernel respectively of relation to eigenvalue decomposition the singular value decomposition is very general in the sense that it can be applied to any matrix whereas eigenvalue decomposition can only be applied to diagonalizable matrices
nevertheless the two decompositions are related
given an svd of as described above the following two relations hold the right hand sides of these relations describe the eigenvalue decompositions of the left hand sides
consequently the columns of right singular vectors are eigenvectors of
the columns of left singular vectors are eigenvectors of mm
the non zero elements of non zero singular values are the square roots of the non zero eigenvalues of or mm in the special case that is normal matrix which by definition must be square the spectral theorem says that it can be unitarily diagonalized using basis of eigenvectors so that it can be written udu for unitary matrix and diagonal matrix with complex elements along the diagonal
when is positive semi definite will be non negative real numbers so that the decomposition udu is also singular value decomposition
otherwise it can be recast as an svd by moving the phase ei of each to either its corresponding vi or ui
the natural connection of the svd to non normal matrices is through the polar decomposition theorem sr where is positive semidefinite and normal and uv is unitary
thus except for positive semi definite matrices the eigenvalue decomposition and svd of while related differ the eigenvalue decomposition is udu where is not necessarily unitary and is not necessarily positive semi definite while the svd is where is diagonal and positive semi definite and and are unitary matrices that are not necessarily related except through the matrix while only non defective square matrices have an eigenvalue decomposition any matrix has svd
applications of the svd pseudoinverse the singular value decomposition can be used for computing the pseudoinverse of matrix
various authors use different notation for the pseudoinverse here we use
indeed the pseudoinverse of the matrix with singular value decomposition is where is the pseudoinverse of which is formed by replacing every non zero diagonal entry by its reciprocal and transposing the resulting matrix
the pseudoinverse is one way to solve linear least squares problems
solving homogeneous linear equations set of homogeneous linear equations can be written as ax for matrix and vector typical situation is that is known and non zero is to be determined which satisfies the equation
such an belongs to null space and is sometimes called right null vector of the vector can be characterized as right singular vector corresponding to singular value of that is zero
this observation means that if is square matrix and has no vanishing singular value the equation has no non zero as solution
it also means that if there are several vanishing singular values any linear combination of the corresponding right singular vectors is valid solution
analogously to the definition of right null vector non zero satisfying with denoting the conjugate transpose of is called left null vector of
total least squares minimization total least squares problem seeks the vector that minimizes the norm of vector ax under the constraint the solution turns out to be the right singular vector of corresponding to the smallest singular value
range null space and rank another application of the svd is that it provides an explicit representation of the range and null space of matrix the right singular vectors corresponding to vanishing singular values of span the null space of and the left singular vectors corresponding to the non zero singular values of span the range of for example in the above example the null space is spanned by the last two rows of and the range is spanned by the first three columns of as consequence the rank of equals the number of non zero singular values which is the same as the number of non zero diagonal elements in in numerical linear algebra the singular values can be used to determine the effective rank of matrix as rounding error may lead to small but non zero singular values in rank deficient matrix
singular values beyond significant gap are assumed to be numerically equivalent to zero
low rank matrix approximation some practical applications need to solve the problem of approximating matrix with another matrix said to be truncated which has specific rank in the case that the approximation is based on minimizing the frobenius norm of the difference between and under the constraint that rank it turns out that the solution is given by the svd of namely where is the same matrix as except that it contains only the largest singular values the other singular values are replaced by zero
this is known as the eckart young theorem as it was proved by those two authors in although it was later found to have been known to earlier authors see stewart
separable models the svd can be thought of as decomposing matrix into weighted ordered sum of separable matrices
by separable we mean that matrix can be written as an outer product of two vectors or in coordinates specifically the matrix can be decomposed as here ui and vi are the th columns of the corresponding svd matrices are the ordered singular values and each ai is separable
the svd can be used to find the decomposition of an image processing filter into separable horizontal and vertical filters
note that the number of non zero is exactly the rank of the matrix
separable models often arise in biological systems and the svd factorization is useful to analyze such systems
for example some visual area simple cells receptive fields can be well described by gabor filter in the space domain multiplied by modulation function in the time domain
thus given linear filter evaluated through for example reverse correlation one can rearrange the two spatial dimensions into one dimension thus yielding two dimensional filter space time which can be decomposed through svd
the first column of in the svd factorization is then gabor while the first column of represents the time modulation or vice versa
one may then define an index of separability which is the fraction of the power in the matrix which is accounted for by the first separable matrix in the decomposition
nearest orthogonal matrix it is possible to use the svd of square matrix to determine the orthogonal matrix closest to the closeness of fit is measured by the frobenius norm of the solution is the product uv
this intuitively makes sense because an orthogonal matrix would have the decomposition uiv where is the identity matrix so that if then the product uv amounts to replacing the singular values with ones
equivalently the solution is the unitary matrix uv of the polar decomposition rp in either order of stretch and rotation as described above
similar problem with interesting applications in shape analysis is the orthogonal procrustes problem which consists of finding an orthogonal matrix which most closely maps to specifically argmin subject to where denotes the frobenius norm
this problem is equivalent to finding the nearest orthogonal matrix to given matrix atb
the kabsch algorithm the kabsch algorithm called wahba problem in other fields uses svd to compute the optimal rotation with respect to least squares minimization that will align set of points with corresponding set of points
it is used among other applications to compare the structures of molecules
signal processing the svd and pseudoinverse have been successfully applied to signal processing image processing and big data in genomic signal processing
other examples the svd is also applied extensively to the study of linear inverse problems and is useful in the analysis of regularization methods such as that of tikhonov
it is widely used in statistics where it is related to principal component analysis and to correspondence analysis and in signal processing and pattern recognition
it is also used in output only modal analysis where the non scaled mode shapes can be determined from the singular vectors
yet another usage is latent semantic indexing in natural language text processing
in general numerical computation involving linear or linearized systems there is universal constant that characterizes the regularity or singularity of problem which is the system condition number max min
it often controls the error rate or convergence rate of given computational scheme on such systems the svd also plays crucial role in the field of quantum information in form often referred to as the schmidt decomposition
through it states of two quantum systems are naturally decomposed providing necessary and sufficient condition for them to be entangled if the rank of the matrix is larger than one
one application of svd to rather large matrices is in numerical weather prediction where lanczos methods are used to estimate the most linearly quickly growing few perturbations to the central numerical weather prediction over given initial forward time period the singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of the linearized propagator for the global weather over that time interval
the output singular vectors in this case are entire weather systems
these perturbations are then run through the full nonlinear model to generate an ensemble forecast giving handle on some of the uncertainty that should be allowed for around the current central prediction
svd has also been applied to reduced order modelling
the aim of reduced order modelling is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in complex system which is to be modeled
svd was coupled with radial basis functions to interpolate solutions to three dimensional unsteady flow problems interestingly svd has been used to improve gravitational waveform modeling by the ground based gravitational wave interferometer aligo
svd can help to increase the accuracy and speed of waveform generation to support gravitational waves searches and update two different waveform models
singular value decomposition is used in recommender systems to predict people item ratings
distributed algorithms have been developed for the purpose of calculating the svd on clusters of commodity machines low rank svd has been applied for hotspot detection from spatiotemporal data with application to disease outbreak detection
combination of svd and higher order svd also has been applied for real time event detection from complex data streams multivariate data with space and time dimensions in disease surveillance
existence proofs an eigenvalue of matrix is characterized by the algebraic relation mu
when is hermitian variational characterization is also available
let be real symmetric matrix
define by the extreme value theorem this continuous function attains maximum at some when restricted to the unit sphere
by the lagrange multipliers theorem necessarily satisfies for some real number the nabla symbol is the del operator differentiation with respect to
using the symmetry of we obtain therefore mu so is unit length eigenvector of for every unit length eigenvector of its eigenvalue is so is the largest eigenvalue of the same calculation performed on the orthogonal complement of gives the next largest eigenvalue and so on
the complex hermitian case is similar there is real valued function of real variables
singular values are similar in that they can be described algebraically or from variational principles
although unlike the eigenvalue case hermiticity or symmetry of is no longer required
this section gives these two arguments for existence of singular value decomposition
based on the spectral theorem let be an complex matrix
since is positive semi definite and hermitian by the spectral theorem there exists an unitary matrix such that where is diagonal and positive definite of dimension with the number of non zero eigenvalues of which can be shown to verify min
note that is here by definition matrix whose th column is the th eigenvector of corresponding to the eigenvalue moreover the th column of for is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue this can be expressed by writing as where the columns of and therefore contain the eigenvectors of corresponding to non zero and zero eigenvalues respectively
using this rewriting of the equation becomes
this implies that moreover the second equation implies finally the unitary ness of translates in terms of and into the following conditions where the subscripts on the identity matrices are used to remark that they are of different dimensions
let us now define then since this can be also seen as immediate consequence of the fact that this is equivalent to the observation that if is the set of eigenvectors of corresponding to non vanishing eigenvalues then is set of orthogonal vectors and is generally not complete set of orthonormal vectors
this matches with the matrix formalism used above denoting with the matrix whose columns are with the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of with vanishing eigenvalue and the matrix whose columns are the vectors we see that this is almost the desired result except that and are in general not unitary since they might not be square
however we do know that the number of rows of is no smaller than the number of columns since the dimensions of is no greater than and also since the columns in are orthonormal and can be extended to an orthonormal basis
this means that we can choose such that is unitary
for we already have to make it unitary
now define where extra zero rows are added or removed to make the number of zero rows equal the number of columns of and hence the overall dimensions of equal to then which is the desired result
notice the argument could begin with diagonalizing mm rather than this shows directly that mm and have the same non zero eigenvalues
based on variational characterization the singular values can also be characterized as the maxima of utmv considered as function of and over particular subspaces
the singular vectors are the values of and where these maxima are attained
let denote an matrix with real entries
let sk be the unit sphere in and define consider the function restricted to sm sn
since both sm and sn are compact sets their product is also compact
furthermore since is continuous it attains largest value for at least one pair of vectors sm and sn
this largest value is denoted and the corresponding vectors are denoted and
since is the largest value of it must be non negative
if it were negative changing the sign of either or would make it positive and therefore larger
are left and right singular vectors of with corresponding singular value
similar to the eigenvalues case by assumption the two vectors satisfy the lagrange multiplier equation after some algebra this becomes multiplying the first equation from left by and the second equation from left by and taking into account gives plugging this into the pair of equations above we have this proves the statement
more singular vectors and singular values can be found by maximizing over normalized which are orthogonal to and respectively
the passage from real to complex is similar to the eigenvalue case
calculating the svd the singular value decomposition can be computed using the following observations the left singular vectors of are set of orthonormal eigenvectors of mm
the right singular vectors of are set of orthonormal eigenvectors of
the non zero singular values of found on the diagonal entries of are the square roots of the non zero eigenvalues of both and mm
numerical approach the svd of matrix is typically computed by two step procedure
in the first step the matrix is reduced to bidiagonal matrix
this takes mn floating point operations flop assuming that the second step is to compute the svd of the bidiagonal matrix
this step can only be done with an iterative method as with eigenvalue algorithms
however in practice it suffices to compute the svd up to certain precision like the machine epsilon
if this precision is considered constant then the second step takes iterations each costing flops
thus the first step is more expensive and the overall cost is mn flops trefethen bau iii lecture
the first step can be done using householder reflections for cost of mn flops assuming that only the singular values are needed and not the singular vectors
if is much larger than then it is advantageous to first reduce the matrix to triangular matrix with the qr decomposition and then use householder reflections to further reduce the matrix to bidiagonal form the combined cost is mn flops trefethen bau iii lecture
the second step can be done by variant of the qr algorithm for the computation of eigenvalues which was first described by golub kahan
the lapack subroutine dbdsqr implements this iterative method with some modifications to cover the case where the singular values are very small demmel kahan
together with first step using householder reflections and if appropriate qr decomposition this forms the dgesvd routine for the computation of the singular value decomposition
the same algorithm is implemented in the gnu scientific library gsl
the gsl also offers an alternative method that uses one sided jacobi orthogonalization in step gsl team
this method computes the svd of the bidiagonal matrix by solving sequence of svd problems similar to how the jacobi eigenvalue algorithm solves sequence of eigenvalue methods golub van loan
yet another method for step uses the idea of divide and conquer eigenvalue algorithms trefethen bau iii lecture
there is an alternative way that does not explicitly use the eigenvalue decomposition
usually the singular value problem of matrix is converted into an equivalent symmetric eigenvalue problem such as or
the approaches that use eigenvalue decompositions are based on the qr algorithm which is well developed to be stable and fast
note that the singular values are real and right and left singular vectors are not required to form similarity transformations
one can iteratively alternate between the qr decomposition and the lq decomposition to find the real diagonal hermitian matrices
the qr decomposition gives and the lq decomposition of gives
thus at every iteration we have update and repeat the orthogonalizations
eventually this iteration between qr decomposition and lq decomposition produces left and right unitary singular matrices
this approach cannot readily be accelerated as the qr algorithm can with spectral shifts or deflation
this is because the shift method is not easily defined without using similarity transformations
however this iterative approach is very simple to implement so is good choice when speed does not matter
this method also provides insight into how purely orthogonal unitary transformations can obtain the svd
analytic result of svd the singular values of matrix can be found analytically
let the matrix be where are complex numbers that parameterize the matrix is the identity matrix and denote the pauli matrices
then its two singular values are given by re re re im im im reduced svds in applications it is quite unusual for the full svd including full unitary decomposition of the null space of the matrix to be required
instead it is often sufficient as well as faster and more economical for storage to compute reduced version of the svd
the following can be distinguished for an matrix of rank thin svd the thin or economy sized svd of matrix is given by where min the matrices uk and vk contain only the first columns of and and contains only the first singular values from the matrix uk is thus is diagonal and vk is
the thin svd uses significantly less space and computation time if max
the first stage in its calculation will usually be qr decomposition of which can make for significantly quicker calculation in this case
compact svd only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the non zero singular values are calculated
the remaining vectors of and are not calculated
this is quicker and more economical than the thin svd if min
the matrix ur is thus is diagonal and vr is
truncated svd in many applications the number of the non zero singular values is large making even the compact svd impractical to compute
in such cases the smallest singular values may need to be truncated to compute only non zero singular values
the truncated svd is no longer an exact decomposition of the original matrix but rather provides the optimal low rank matrix approximation by any matrix of fixed rank where matrix ut is is diagonal and vt is
only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the largest singular values are calculated
this can be much quicker and more economical than the compact svd if but requires completely different toolset of numerical solvers
in applications that require an approximation to the moore penrose inverse of the matrix the smallest singular values of are of interest which are more challenging to compute compared to the largest ones
truncated svd is employed in latent semantic indexing
norms ky fan norms the sum of the largest singular values of is matrix norm the ky fan norm of the first of the ky fan norms the ky fan norm is the same as the operator norm of as linear operator with respect to the euclidean norms of km and kn
in other words the ky fan norm is the operator norm induced by the standard euclidean inner product
for this reason it is also called the operator norm
one can easily verify the relationship between the ky fan norm and singular values
it is true in general for bounded operator on possibly infinite dimensional hilbert spaces but in the matrix case is normal matrix so is the largest eigenvalue of
the largest singular value of the last of the ky fan norms the sum of all singular values is the trace norm also known as the nuclear norm defined by tr the eigenvalues of are the squares of the singular values
hilbert schmidt norm the singular values are related to another norm on the space of operators
consider the hilbert schmidt inner product on the matrices defined by tr
so the induced norm is tr
since the trace is invariant under unitary equivalence this shows where are the singular values of this is called the frobenius norm schatten norm or hilbert schmidt norm of direct calculation shows that the frobenius norm of mij coincides with in addition the frobenius norm and the trace norm the nuclear norm are special cases of the schatten norm
variations and generalizations mode representation can be represented using mode multiplication of matrix applying then on the result that is tensor svd two types of tensor decompositions exist which generalise the svd to multi way arrays
one of them decomposes tensor into sum of rank tensors which is called tensor rank decomposition
the second type of decomposition computes the orthonormal subspaces associated with the different factors appearing in the tensor product of vector spaces in which the tensor lives
this decomposition is referred to in the literature as the higher order svd hosvd or tucker tuckerm
in addition multilinear principal component analysis in multilinear subspace learning involves the same mathematical operations as tucker decomposition being used in different context of dimensionality reduction
scale invariant svd the singular values of matrix are uniquely defined and are invariant with respect to left and or right unitary transformations of in other words the singular values of uav for unitary and are equal to the singular values of this is an important property for applications in which it is necessary to preserve euclidean distances and invariance with respect to rotations
the scale invariant svd or si svd is analogous to the conventional svd except that its uniquely determined singular values are invariant with respect to diagonal transformations of in other words the singular values of dae for invertible diagonal matrices and are equal to the singular values of this is an important property for applications for which invariance to the choice of units on variables metric versus imperial units is needed
higher order svd of functions hosvd tensor product tp model transformation numerically reconstruct the hosvd of functions
for further details please visit tensor product model transformation hosvd based canonical form of tp functions and qlpv models tp model transformation in control theory bounded operators on hilbert spaces the factorization can be extended to bounded operator on separable hilbert space namely for any bounded operator there exist partial isometry unitary measure space and non negative measurable such that where is the multiplication by on
this can be shown by mimicking the linear algebraic argument for the matricial case above
vtfv is the unique positive square root of as given by the borel functional calculus for self adjoint operators
the reason why need not be unitary is because unlike the finite dimensional case given an isometry with nontrivial kernel suitable may not be found such that is unitary operator
as for matrices the singular value factorization is equivalent to the polar decomposition for operators we can simply write and notice that is still partial isometry while vtfv is positive
singular values and compact operators the notion of singular values and left right singular vectors can be extended to compact operator on hilbert space as they have discrete spectrum
if is compact every non zero in its spectrum is an eigenvalue
furthermore compact self adjoint operator can be diagonalized by its eigenvectors
if is compact so is
applying the diagonalization result the unitary image of its positive square root tf has set of orthonormal eigenvectors
for any where the series converges in the norm topology on notice how this resembles the expression from the finite dimensional case
are called the singular values of can be considered the left singular resp
right singular vectors of compact operators on hilbert space are the closure of finite rank operators in the uniform operator topology
the above series expression gives an explicit such representation
an immediate consequence of this is theorem
is compact if and only if is compact
history the singular value decomposition was originally developed by differential geometers who wished to determine whether real bilinear form could be made equal to another by independent orthogonal transformations of the two spaces it acts on
eugenio beltrami and camille jordan discovered independently in and respectively that the singular values of the bilinear forms represented as matrix form complete set of invariants for bilinear forms under orthogonal substitutions
james joseph sylvester also arrived at the singular value decomposition for real square matrices in apparently independently of both beltrami and jordan
sylvester called the singular values the canonical multipliers of the matrix the fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is autonne in who arrived at it via the polar decomposition
the first proof of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by carl eckart and gale young in they saw it as generalization of the principal axis transformation for hermitian matrices
in erhard schmidt defined an analog of singular values for integral operators which are compact under some weak technical assumptions it seems he was unaware of the parallel work on singular values of finite matrices
this theory was further developed by mile picard in who is the first to call the numbers singular values or in french valeurs singuli res
practical methods for computing the svd date back to kogbetliantz in and hestenes in resembling closely the jacobi eigenvalue algorithm which uses plane rotations or givens rotations
however these were replaced by the method of gene golub and william kahan published in which uses householder transformations or reflections
in golub and christian reinsch published variant of the golub kahan algorithm that is still the one most used today

in information theory low density parity check ldpc code is linear error correcting code method of transmitting message over noisy transmission channel
an ldpc code is constructed using sparse tanner graph subclass of the bipartite graph
ldpc codes are capacity approaching codes which means that practical constructions exist that allow the noise threshold to be set very close to the theoretical maximum the shannon limit for symmetric memoryless channel
the noise threshold defines an upper bound for the channel noise up to which the probability of lost information can be made as small as desired
using iterative belief propagation techniques ldpc codes can be decoded in time linear to their block length
ldpc codes are finding increasing use in applications requiring reliable and highly efficient information transfer over bandwidth constrained or return channel constrained links in the presence of corrupting noise
implementation of ldpc codes has lagged behind that of other codes notably turbo codes
the fundamental patent for turbo codes expired on august ldpc codes are also known as gallager codes in honor of robert gallager who developed the ldpc concept in his doctoral dissertation at the massachusetts institute of technology in ldpc codes have also been shown to have ideal combinatorial properties
in his dissertation gallager showed that ldpc codes achieve the gilbert varshamov bound for linear codes over binary fields with high probability
in it was shown that gallager ldpc codes achieve list decoding capacity and also achieve the gilbert varshamov bound for linear codes over general fields
history impractical to implement when first developed by gallager in ldpc codes were forgotten until his work was rediscovered in turbo codes another class of capacity approaching codes discovered in became the coding scheme of choice in the late used for applications such as the deep space network and satellite communications
however the advances in low density parity check codes have seen them surpass turbo codes in terms of error floor and performance in the higher code rate range leaving turbo codes better suited for the lower code rates only
applications in an irregular repeat accumulate ira style ldpc code beat six turbo codes to become the error correcting code in the new dvb standard for digital television
the dvb selection committee made decoder complexity estimates for the turbo code proposals using much less efficient serial decoder architecture rather than parallel decoder architecture
this forced the turbo code proposals to use frame sizes on the order of one half the frame size of the ldpc proposals
in ldpc beat convolutional turbo codes as the forward error correction fec system for the itu hn standard
hn chose ldpc codes over turbo codes because of their lower decoding complexity especially when operating at data rates close to gbit and because the proposed turbo codes exhibited significant error floor at the desired range of operation ldpc codes are also used for gbase ethernet which sends data at gigabits per second over twisted pair cables
as of ldpc codes are also part of the wi fi standard as an optional part of and ac in the high throughput ht phy specification
ldpc is mandatory part of ax wi fi some ofdm systems add an additional outer error correction that fixes the occasional errors the error floor that get past the ldpc correction inner code even at low bit error rates
for example the reed solomon code with ldpc coded modulation rs lcm uses reed solomon outer code
the dvb the dvb and the dvb standards all use bch code outer code to mop up residual errors after ldpc decoding nr uses polar code for the control channels and ldpc for the data channels although ldpc code has had its success in commercial hard disk drives to fully exploit its error correction capability in ssds demands unconventional fine grained flash memory sensing leading to an increased memory read latency
ldpc in ssd is an effective approach to deploy ldpc in ssd with very small latency increase which turns ldpc in ssd into reality
since then ldpc has been widely adopted in commercial ssds in both customer grades and enterprise grades by major storage venders
many tlc and later ssds are using ldpc codes
fast hard decode binary erasure is first attempted which can fall back into the slower but more powerful soft decoding
operational use ldpc codes functionally are defined by sparse parity check matrix
this sparse matrix is often randomly generated subject to the sparsity constraints ldpc code construction is discussed later
these codes were first designed by robert gallager in below is graph fragment of an example ldpc code using forney factor graph notation
in this graph variable nodes in the top of the graph are connected to constraint nodes in the bottom of the graph
this is popular way of graphically representing an ldpc code
the bits of valid message when placed on the at the top of the graph satisfy the graphical constraints
specifically all lines connecting to variable node box with an sign have the same value and all values connecting to factor node box with sign must sum modulo two to zero in other words they must sum to an even number or there must be an even number of odd values
ignoring any lines going out of the picture there are eight possible six bit strings corresponding to valid codewords
this ldpc code fragment represents three bit message encoded as six bits
redundancy is used here to increase the chance of recovering from channel errors
this is linear code with and again ignoring lines going out of the picture the parity check matrix representing this graph fragment is
in this matrix each row represents one of the three parity check constraints while each column represents one of the six bits in the received codeword
in this example the eight codewords can be obtained by putting the parity check matrix into this form through basic row operations in gf step step row is added to row step row and are swapped
step row is added to row from this the generator matrix can be obtained as noting that in the special case of this being binary code or specifically
finally by multiplying all eight possible bit strings by all eight valid codewords are obtained
for example the codeword for the bit string is obtained by where is symbol of mod multiplication
as check the row space of is orthogonal to such that the bit string is found in as the first bits of the codeword
example encoder figure illustrates the functional components of most ldpc encoders
during the encoding of frame the input data bits are repeated and distributed to set of constituent encoders
the constituent encoders are typically accumulators and each accumulator is used to generate parity symbol
single copy of the original data is transmitted with the parity bits to make up the code symbols
the bits from each constituent encoder are discarded
the parity bit may be used within another constituent code
in an example using the dvb rate code the encoded block size is symbols with data bits and parity bits
each constituent code check node encodes data bits except for the first parity bit which encodes data bits
the first data bits are repeated times used in parity codes while the remaining data bits are used in parity codes irregular ldpc code
for comparison classic turbo codes typically use two constituent codes configured in parallel each of which encodes the entire input block of data bits
these constituent encoders are recursive convolutional codes rsc of moderate depth or states that are separated by code interleaver which interleaves one copy of the frame
the ldpc code in contrast uses many low depth constituent codes accumulators in parallel each of which encode only small portion of the input frame
the many constituent codes can be viewed as many low depth state convolutional codes that are connected via the repeat and distribute operations
the repeat and distribute operations perform the function of the interleaver in the turbo code
the ability to more precisely manage the connections of the various constituent codes and the level of redundancy for each input bit give more flexibility in the design of ldpc codes which can lead to better performance than turbo codes in some instances
turbo codes still seem to perform better than ldpcs at low code rates or at least the design of well performing low rate codes is easier for turbo codes
as practical matter the hardware that forms the accumulators is reused during the encoding process
that is once first set of parity bits are generated and the parity bits stored the same accumulator hardware is used to generate next set of parity bits
decoding as with other codes the maximum likelihood decoding of an ldpc code on the binary symmetric channel is an np complete problem
performing optimal decoding for np complete code of any useful size is not practical
however sub optimal techniques based on iterative belief propagation decoding give excellent results and can be practically implemented
the sub optimal decoding techniques view each parity check that makes up the ldpc as an independent single parity check spc code
each spc code is decoded separately using soft in soft out siso techniques such as sova bcjr map and other derivates thereof
the soft decision information from each siso decoding is cross checked and updated with other redundant spc decodings of the same information bit
each spc code is then decoded again using the updated soft decision information
this process is iterated until valid codeword is achieved or decoding is exhausted
this type of decoding is often referred to as sum product decoding
the decoding of the spc codes is often referred to as the check node processing and the cross checking of the variables is often referred to as the variable node processing
in practical ldpc decoder implementation sets of spc codes are decoded in parallel to increase throughput
in contrast belief propagation on the binary erasure channel is particularly simple where it consists of iterative constraint satisfaction
for example consider that the valid codeword from the example above is transmitted across binary erasure channel and received with the first and fourth bit erased to yield
since the transmitted message must have satisfied the code constraints the message can be represented by writing the received message on the top of the factor graph
in this example the first bit cannot yet be recovered because all of the constraints connected to it have more than one unknown bit
in order to proceed with decoding the message constraints connecting to only one of the erased bits must be identified
in this example only the second constraint suffices
examining the second constraint the fourth bit must have been zero since only zero in that position would satisfy the constraint
this procedure is then iterated
the new value for the fourth bit can now be used in conjunction with the first constraint to recover the first bit as seen below
this means that the first bit must be one to satisfy the leftmost constraint
thus the message can be decoded iteratively
for other channel models the messages passed between the variable nodes and check nodes are real numbers which express probabilities and likelihoods of belief
this result can be validated by multiplying the corrected codeword by the parity check matrix
because the outcome the syndrome of this operation is the three one zero vector the resulting codeword is successfully validated
after the decoding is completed the original message bits can be extracted by looking at the first bits of the codeword
while illustrative this erasure example does not show the use of soft decision decoding or soft decision message passing which is used in virtually all commercial ldpc decoders
updating node information in recent years there has also been great deal of work spent studying the effects of alternative schedules for variable node and constraint node update
the original technique that was used for decoding ldpc codes was known as flooding
this type of update required that before updating variable node all constraint nodes needed to be updated and vice versa
in later work by vila casado et al alternative update techniques were studied in which variable nodes are updated with the newest available check node information
the intuition behind these algorithms is that variable nodes whose values vary the most are the ones that need to be updated first
highly reliable nodes whose log likelihood ratio llr magnitude is large and does not change significantly from one update to the next do not require updates with the same frequency as other nodes whose sign and magnitude fluctuate more widely
these scheduling algorithms show greater speed of convergence and lower error floors than those that use flooding
these lower error floors are achieved by the ability of the informed dynamic scheduling ids algorithm to overcome trapping sets of near codewords when nonflooding scheduling algorithms are used an alternative definition of iteration is used
for an ldpc code of rate full iteration occurs when variable and constraint nodes have been updated no matter the order in which they were updated
code construction for large block sizes ldpc codes are commonly constructed by first studying the behaviour of decoders
as the block size tends to infinity ldpc decoders can be shown to have noise threshold below which decoding is reliably achieved and above which decoding is not achieved colloquially referred to as the cliff effect
this threshold can be optimised by finding the best proportion of arcs from check nodes and arcs from variable nodes
an approximate graphical approach to visualising this threshold is an exit chart
the construction of specific ldpc code after this optimization falls into two main types of techniques pseudorandom approaches combinatorial approachesconstruction by pseudo random approach builds on theoretical results that for large block size random construction gives good decoding performance
in general pseudorandom codes have complex encoders but pseudorandom codes with the best decoders can have simple encoders
various constraints are often applied to help ensure that the desired properties expected at the theoretical limit of infinite block size occur at finite block size
combinatorial approaches can be used to optimize the properties of small block size ldpc codes or to create codes with simple encoders
some ldpc codes are based on reed solomon codes such as the rs ldpc code used in the gigabit ethernet standard
compared to randomly generated ldpc codes structured ldpc codes such as the ldpc code used in the dvb standard can have simpler and therefore lower cost hardware in particular codes constructed such that the matrix is circulant matrix yet another way of constructing ldpc codes is to use finite geometries
this method was proposed by kou et al
ldpc codes vs turbo codes ldpc codes can be compared with other powerful coding schemes
in one hand ber performance of turbo codes is influenced by low codes limitations
ldpc codes have no limitations of minimum distance that indirectly means that ldpc codes may be more efficient on relatively large code rates
however ldpc codes are not the complete replacement turbo codes are the best solution at the lower code rates

in mathematics spectral theory is an inclusive term for theories extending the eigenvector and eigenvalue theory of single square matrix to much broader theory of the structure of operators in variety of mathematical spaces
it is result of studies of linear algebra and the solutions of systems of linear equations and their generalizations
the theory is connected to that of analytic functions because the spectral properties of an operator are related to analytic functions of the spectral parameter
mathematical background the name spectral theory was introduced by david hilbert in his original formulation of hilbert space theory which was cast in terms of quadratic forms in infinitely many variables
the original spectral theorem was therefore conceived as version of the theorem on principal axes of an ellipsoid in an infinite dimensional setting
the later discovery in quantum mechanics that spectral theory could explain features of atomic spectra was therefore fortuitous
hilbert himself was surprised by the unexpected application of this theory noting that developed my theory of infinitely many variables from purely mathematical interests and even called it spectral analysis without any presentiment that it would later find application to the actual spectrum of physics
there have been three main ways to formulate spectral theory each of which find use in different domains
after hilbert initial formulation the later development of abstract hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of single normal operators on them were well suited to the requirements of physics exemplified by the work of von neumann
the further theory built on this to address banach algebras in general
this development leads to the gelfand representation which covers the commutative case and further into non commutative harmonic analysis
the difference can be seen in making the connection with fourier analysis
the fourier transform on the real line is in one sense the spectral theory of differentiation qua differential operator
but for that to cover the phenomena one has already to deal with generalized eigenfunctions for example by means of rigged hilbert space
on the other hand it is simple to construct group algebra the spectrum of which captures the fourier transform basic properties and this is carried out by means of pontryagin duality
one can also study the spectral properties of operators on banach spaces
for example compact operators on banach spaces have many spectral properties similar to that of matrices
physical background the background in the physics of vibrations has been explained in this way spectral theory is connected with the investigation of localized vibrations of variety of different objects from atoms and molecules in chemistry to obstacles in acoustic waveguides
these vibrations have frequencies and the issue is to decide when such localized vibrations occur and how to go about computing the frequencies
this is very complicated problem since every object has not only fundamental tone but also complicated series of overtones which vary radically from one body to another
such physical ideas have nothing to do with the mathematical theory on technical level but there are examples of indirect involvement see for example mark kac question can you hear the shape of drum
hilbert adoption of the term spectrum has been attributed to an paper of wilhelm wirtinger on hill differential equation by jean dieudonn and it was taken up by his students during the first decade of the twentieth century among them erhard schmidt and hermann weyl
the conceptual basis for hilbert space was developed from hilbert ideas by erhard schmidt and frigyes riesz
it was almost twenty years later when quantum mechanics was formulated in terms of the schr dinger equation that the connection was made to atomic spectra connection with the mathematical physics of vibration had been suspected before as remarked by henri poincar but rejected for simple quantitative reasons absent an explanation of the balmer series
the later discovery in quantum mechanics that spectral theory could explain features of atomic spectra was therefore fortuitous rather than being an object of hilbert spectral theory
definition of spectrum consider bounded linear transformation defined everywhere over general banach space
we form the transformation here is the identity operator and is complex number
the inverse of an operator that is is defined by if the inverse exists is called regular
if it does not exist is called singular
with these definitions the resolvent set of is the set of all complex numbers such that exists and is bounded
this set often is denoted as
the spectrum of is the set of all complex numbers such that fails to exist or is unbounded
often the spectrum of is denoted by
the function for all in that is wherever exists as bounded operator is called the resolvent of the spectrum of is therefore the complement of the resolvent set of in the complex plane
every eigenvalue of belongs to but may contain non eigenvalues this definition applies to banach space but of course other types of space exist as well for example topological vector spaces include banach spaces but can be more general
on the other hand banach spaces include hilbert spaces and it is these spaces that find the greatest application and the richest theoretical results
with suitable restrictions much can be said about the structure of the spectra of transformations in hilbert space
in particular for self adjoint operators the spectrum lies on the real line and in general is spectral combination of point spectrum of discrete eigenvalues and continuous spectrum
spectral theory briefly in functional analysis and linear algebra the spectral theorem establishes conditions under which an operator can be expressed in simple form as sum of simpler operators
as full rigorous presentation is not appropriate for this article we take an approach that avoids much of the rigor and satisfaction of formal treatment with the aim of being more comprehensible to non specialist
this topic is easiest to describe by introducing the bra ket notation of dirac for operators
as an example very particular linear operator might be written as dyadic product in terms of the bra and the ket
function is described by ket as
the function defined on the coordinates is denoted as and the magnitude of by where the notation denotes complex conjugate
this inner product choice defines very specific inner product space restricting the generality of the arguments that follow the effect of upon function is then described as expressing the result that the effect of on is to produce new function multiplied by the inner product represented by
more general linear operator might be expressed as where the are scalars and the are basis and the reciprocal basis for the space
the relation between the basis and the reciprocal basis is described in part by if such formalism applies the are eigenvalues of and the functions are eigenfunctions of the eigenvalues are in the spectrum of some natural questions are under what circumstances does this formalism work and for what operators are expansions in series of other operators like this possible
can any function be expressed in terms of the eigenfunctions are they schauder basis and under what circumstances does point spectrum or continuous spectrum arise
how do the formalisms for infinite dimensional spaces and finite dimensional spaces differ or do they differ
can these ideas be extended to broader class of spaces
answering such questions is the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra
resolution of the identity this section continues in the rough and ready manner of the above section using the bra ket notation and glossing over the many important details of rigorous treatment
rigorous mathematical treatment may be found in various references
in particular the dimension of the space will be finite
using the bra ket notation of the above section the identity operator may be written as where it is supposed as above that are basis and the reciprocal basis for the space satisfying the relation this expression of the identity operation is called representation or resolution of the identity
this formal representation satisfies the basic property of the identity valid for every positive integer applying the resolution of the identity to any function in the space one obtains which is the generalized fourier expansion of in terms of the basis functions
given some operator equation of the form with in the space this equation can be solved in the above basis through the formal manipulations which converts the operator equation to matrix equation determining the unknown coefficients cj in terms of the generalized fourier coefficients of and the matrix elements of the operator the role of spectral theory arises in establishing the nature and existence of the basis and the reciprocal basis
in particular the basis might consist of the eigenfunctions of some linear operator with the the eigenvalues of from the spectrum of then the resolution of the identity above provides the dyad expansion of
resolvent operator using spectral theory the resolvent operator can be evaluated in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of and the green function corresponding to can be found
applying to some arbitrary function in the space say
this function has poles in the complex plane at each eigenvalue of thus using the calculus of residues where the line integral is over contour that includes all the eigenvalues of suppose our functions are defined over some coordinates that is
introducing the notation where is the dirac delta function we can write then the function defined by is called the green function for operator and satisfies
operator equations consider the operator equation in terms of coordinates
particular case is the green function of the previous section is and satisfies
using this green function property
then multiplying both sides of this equation by and integrating which suggests the solution is that is the function satisfying the operator equation is found if we can find the spectrum of and construct for example by using there are many other ways to find of course
see the articles on green functions and on fredholm integral equations
it must be kept in mind that the above mathematics is purely formal and rigorous treatment involves some pretty sophisticated mathematics including good background knowledge of functional analysis hilbert spaces distributions and so forth

spectral theorem and rayleigh quotient optimization problems may be the most useful examples about the combinatorial significance of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in symmetric matrices especially for the rayleigh quotient with respect to matrix theorem let be symmetric matrix and let be the non zero vector that maximizes the rayleigh quotient with respect to then is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue equal to the rayleigh quotient
moreover this eigenvalue is the largest eigenvalue of proof assume the spectral theorem
let the eigenvalues of be since the form an orthonormal basis any vector can be expressed in this basis as the way to prove this formula is pretty easy
namely evaluate the rayleigh quotient with respect to where we used parseval identity in the last line

in statistics principal component regression pcr is regression analysis technique that is based on principal component analysis pca
more specifically pcr is used for estimating the unknown regression coefficients in standard linear regression model
in pcr instead of regressing the dependent variable on the explanatory variables directly the principal components of the explanatory variables are used as regressors
one typically uses only subset of all the principal components for regression making pcr kind of regularized procedure and also type of shrinkage estimator
often the principal components with higher variances the ones based on eigenvectors corresponding to the higher eigenvalues of the sample variance covariance matrix of the explanatory variables are selected as regressors
however for the purpose of predicting the outcome the principal components with low variances may also be important in some cases even more important one major use of pcr lies in overcoming the multicollinearity problem which arises when two or more of the explanatory variables are close to being collinear
pcr can aptly deal with such situations by excluding some of the low variance principal components in the regression step
in addition by usually regressing on only subset of all the principal components pcr can result in dimension reduction through substantially lowering the effective number of parameters characterizing the underlying model
this can be particularly useful in settings with high dimensional covariates
also through appropriate selection of the principal components to be used for regression pcr can lead to efficient prediction of the outcome based on the assumed model
the principle the pcr method may be broadly divided into three major steps perform pca on the observed data matrix for the explanatory variables to obtain the principal components and then usually select subset based on some appropriate criteria of the principal components so obtained for further use
now regress the observed vector of outcomes on the selected principal components as covariates using ordinary least squares regression linear regression to get vector of estimated regression coefficients with dimension equal to the number of selected principal components now transform this vector back to the scale of the actual covariates using the selected pca loadings the eigenvectors corresponding to the selected principal components to get the final pcr estimator with dimension equal to the total number of covariates for estimating the regression coefficients characterizing the original model
details of the method data representation let denote the vector of observed outcomes and denote the corresponding data matrix of observed covariates where and denote the size of the observed sample and the number of covariates respectively with each of the rows of denotes one set of observations for the dimensional covariate and the respective entry of denotes the corresponding observed outcome
data pre processing assume that and each of the columns of have already been centered so that all of them have zero empirical means
this centering step is crucial at least for the columns of since pcr involves the use of pca on and pca is sensitive to centering of the data
underlying model following centering the standard gauss markov linear regression model for on can be represented as where denotes the unknown parameter vector of regression coefficients and denotes the vector of random errors with and var for some unknown variance parameter objective the primary goal is to obtain an efficient estimator for the parameter based on the data
one frequently used approach for this is ordinary least squares regression which assuming is full column rank gives the unbiased estimator of pcr is another technique that may be used for the same purpose of estimating pca step pcr starts by performing pca on the centered data matrix for this let denote the singular value decomposition of where diag with denoting the non negative singular values of while the columns of and are both orthonormal sets of vectors denoting the left and right singular vectors of respectively
the principal components gives spectral decomposition of where diag diag with denoting the non negative eigenvalues also known as the principal values of while the columns of denote the corresponding orthonormal set of eigenvectors
then and respectively denote the principal component and the principal component direction or pca loading corresponding to the th largest principal value for each
derived covariates for any let denote the matrix with orthonormal columns consisting of the first columns of let denote the matrix having the first principal components as its columns
may be viewed as the data matrix obtained by using the transformed covariates instead of using the original covariates the pcr estimator let denote the vector of estimated regression coefficients obtained by ordinary least squares regression of the response vector on the data matrix then for any the final pcr estimator of based on using the first principal components is given by fundamental characteristics and applications of the pcr estimator two basic properties the fitting process for obtaining the pcr estimator involves regressing the response vector on the derived data matrix which has orthogonal columns for any since the principal components are mutually orthogonal to each other
thus in the regression step performing multiple linear regression jointly on the selected principal components as covariates is equivalent to carrying out independent simple linear regressions or univariate regressions separately on each of the selected principal components as covariate
when all the principal components are selected for regression so that then the pcr estimator is equivalent to the ordinary least squares estimator
thus this is easily seen from the fact that and also observing that is an orthogonal matrix
variance reduction for any the variance of is given by var diag in particular var var hence for all we have var var thus for all we have var var where indicates that square symmetric matrix is non negative definite
consequently any given linear form of the pcr estimator has lower variance compared to that of the same linear form of the ordinary least squares estimator
addressing multicollinearity under multicollinearity two or more of the covariates are highly correlated so that one can be linearly predicted from the others with non trivial degree of accuracy
consequently the columns of the data matrix that correspond to the observations for these covariates tend to become linearly dependent and therefore tends to become rank deficient losing its full column rank structure
more quantitatively one or more of the smaller eigenvalues of get very close or become exactly equal to under such situations
the variance expressions above indicate that these small eigenvalues have the maximum inflation effect on the variance of the least squares estimator thereby destabilizing the estimator significantly when they are close to this issue can be effectively addressed through using pcr estimator obtained by excluding the principal components corresponding to these small eigenvalues
dimension reduction pcr may also be used for performing dimension reduction
to see this let denote any matrix having orthonormal columns for any
suppose now that we want to approximate each of the covariate observations through the rank linear transformation for some
then it can be shown that is minimized at the matrix with the first principal component directions as columns and the corresponding dimensional derived covariates
thus the dimensional principal components provide the best linear approximation of rank to the observed data matrix the corresponding reconstruction error is given by thus any potential dimension reduction may be achieved by choosing the number of principal components to be used through appropriate thresholding on the cumulative sum of the eigenvalues of since the smaller eigenvalues do not contribute significantly to the cumulative sum the corresponding principal components may be continued to be dropped as long as the desired threshold limit is not exceeded
the same criteria may also be used for addressing the multicollinearity issue whereby the principal components corresponding to the smaller eigenvalues may be ignored as long as the threshold limit is maintained
regularization effect since the pcr estimator typically uses only subset of all the principal components for regression it can be viewed as some sort of regularized procedure
more specifically for any the pcr estimator denotes the regularized solution to the following constrained minimization problem min subject to
the constraint may be equivalently written as where
thus when only proper subset of all the principal components are selected for regression the pcr estimator so obtained is based on hard form of regularization that constrains the resulting solution to the column space of the selected principal component directions and consequently restricts it to be orthogonal to the excluded directions
optimality of pcr among class of regularized estimators given the constrained minimization problem as defined above consider the following generalized version of it min subject to where denotes any full column rank matrix of order with let denote the corresponding solution
thus arg min subject to then the optimal choice of the restriction matrix for which the corresponding estimator achieves the minimum prediction error is given by where diag
quite clearly the resulting optimal estimator is then simply given by the pcr estimator based on the first principal components
efficiency since the ordinary least squares estimator is unbiased for we have var mse where mse denotes the mean squared error
now if for some we additionally have then the corresponding is also unbiased for and therefore var mse
we have already seen that var var which then implies mse mse for that particular thus in that case the corresponding would be more efficient estimator of compared to based on using the mean squared error as the performance criteria
in addition any given linear form of the corresponding would also have lower mean squared error compared to that of the same linear form of now suppose that for given then the corresponding is biased for however since var var it is still possible that mse mse especially if is such that the excluded principal components correspond to the smaller eigenvalues thereby resulting in lower bias
in order to ensure efficient estimation and prediction performance of pcr as an estimator of park proposes the following guideline for selecting the principal components to be used for regression drop the principal component if and only if practical implementation of this guideline of course requires estimates for the unknown model parameters and in general they may be estimated using the unrestricted least squares estimates obtained from the original full model
park however provides slightly modified set of estimates that may be better suited for this purpose unlike the criteria based on the cumulative sum of the eigenvalues of which is probably more suited for addressing the multicollinearity problem and for performing dimension reduction the above criteria actually attempts to improve the prediction and estimation efficiency of the pcr estimator by involving both the outcome as well as the covariates in the process of selecting the principal components to be used in the regression step
alternative approaches with similar goals include selection of the principal components based on cross validation or the mallow cp criteria
often the principal components are also selected based on their degree of association with the outcome
shrinkage effect of pcr in general pcr is essentially shrinkage estimator that usually retains the high variance principal components corresponding to the higher eigenvalues of as covariates in the model and discards the remaining low variance components corresponding to the lower eigenvalues of
thus it exerts discrete shrinkage effect on the low variance components nullifying their contribution completely in the original model
in contrast the ridge regression estimator exerts smooth shrinkage effect through the regularization parameter or the tuning parameter inherently involved in its construction
while it does not completely discard any of the components it exerts shrinkage effect over all of them in continuous manner so that the extent of shrinkage is higher for the low variance components and lower for the high variance components
frank and friedman conclude that for the purpose of prediction itself the ridge estimator owing to its smooth shrinkage effect is perhaps better choice compared to the pcr estimator having discrete shrinkage effect
in addition the principal components are obtained from the eigen decomposition of that involves the observations for the explanatory variables only
therefore the resulting pcr estimator obtained from using these principal components as covariates need not necessarily have satisfactory predictive performance for the outcome
somewhat similar estimator that tries to address this issue through its very construction is the partial least squares pls estimator
similar to pcr pls also uses derived covariates of lower dimensions
however unlike pcr the derived covariates for pls are obtained based on using both the outcome as well as the covariates
while pcr seeks the high variance directions in the space of the covariates pls seeks the directions in the covariate space that are most useful for the prediction of the outcome
variant of the classical pcr known as the supervised pcr was proposed
in spirit similar to that of pls it attempts at obtaining derived covariates of lower dimensions based on criterion that involves both the outcome as well as the covariates
the method starts by performing set of simple linear regressions or univariate regressions wherein the outcome vector is regressed separately on each of the covariates taken one at time
then for some the first covariates that turn out to be the most correlated with the outcome based on the degree of significance of the corresponding estimated regression coefficients are selected for further use
conventional pcr as described earlier is then performed but now it is based on only the data matrix corresponding to the observations for the selected covariates
the number of covariates used and the subsequent number of principal components used are usually selected by cross validation
generalization to kernel settings the classical pcr method as described above is based on classical pca and considers linear regression model for predicting the outcome based on the covariates
however it can be easily generalized to kernel machine setting whereby the regression function need not necessarily be linear in the covariates but instead it can belong to the reproducing kernel hilbert space associated with any arbitrary possibly non linear symmetric positive definite kernel
the linear regression model turns out to be special case of this setting when the kernel function is chosen to be the linear kernel
in general under the kernel machine setting the vector of covariates is first mapped into high dimensional potentially infinite dimensional feature space characterized by the kernel function chosen
the mapping so obtained is known as the feature map and each of its coordinates also known as the feature elements corresponds to one feature may be linear or non linear of the covariates
the regression function is then assumed to be linear combination of these feature elements
thus the underlying regression model in the kernel machine setting is essentially linear regression model with the understanding that instead of the original set of covariates the predictors are now given by the vector potentially infinite dimensional of feature elements obtained by transforming the actual covariates using the feature map
however the kernel trick actually enables us to operate in the feature space without ever explicitly computing the feature map
it turns out that it is only sufficient to compute the pairwise inner products among the feature maps for the observed covariate vectors and these inner products are simply given by the values of the kernel function evaluated at the corresponding pairs of covariate vectors
the pairwise inner products so obtained may therefore be represented in the form of symmetric non negative definite matrix also known as the kernel matrix
pcr in the kernel machine setting can now be implemented by first appropriately centering this kernel matrix say with respect to the feature space and then performing kernel pca on the centered kernel matrix say whereby an eigendecomposition of is obtained
kernel pcr then proceeds by usually selecting subset of all the eigenvectors so obtained and then performing standard linear regression of the outcome vector on these selected eigenvectors
the eigenvectors to be used for regression are usually selected using cross validation
the estimated regression coefficients having the same dimension as the number of selected eigenvectors along with the corresponding selected eigenvectors are then used for predicting the outcome for future observation
in machine learning this technique is also known as spectral regression
clearly kernel pcr has discrete shrinkage effect on the eigenvectors of quite similar to the discrete shrinkage effect of classical pcr on the principal components as discussed earlier
however the feature map associated with the chosen kernel could potentially be infinite dimensional and hence the corresponding principal components and principal component directions could be infinite dimensional as well
therefore these quantities are often practically intractable under the kernel machine setting
kernel pcr essentially works around this problem by considering an equivalent dual formulation based on using the spectral decomposition of the associated kernel matrix
under the linear regression model which corresponds to choosing the kernel function as the linear kernel this amounts to considering spectral decomposition of the corresponding kernel matrix and then regressing the outcome vector on selected subset of the eigenvectors of so obtained
it can be easily shown that this is the same as regressing the outcome vector on the corresponding principal components which are finite dimensional in this case as defined in the context of the classical pcr
thus for the linear kernel the kernel pcr based on dual formulation is exactly equivalent to the classical pcr based on primal formulation
however for arbitrary and possibly non linear kernels this primal formulation may become intractable owing to the infinite dimensionality of the associated feature map
thus classical pcr becomes practically infeasible in that case but kernel pcr based on the dual formulation still remains valid and computationally scalable

cornelius cornel lanczos hungarian nczos korn pronounced la nt so korne born as korn wy until wy wy korn february june was hungarian american and later hungarian irish mathematician and physicist
according to gy rgy marx he was one of the martians
biography he was born in feh rv alba regia fej county kingdom of hungary to roly wy and ad hahn
lanczos ph thesis was on relativity theory
he sent his thesis copy to albert einstein and einstein wrote back saying studied your paper as far as my present overload allowed
believe may say this much this does involve competent and original brainwork on the basis of which doctorate should be obtainable gladly accept the honorable dedication
in he discovered an exact solution of the einstein field equation representing cylindrically symmetric rigidly rotating configuration of dust particles
this was later rediscovered by willem jacob van stockum and is known today as the van stockum dust
it is one of the simplest known exact solutions in general relativity and is regarded as an important example in part because it exhibits closed timelike curves
lanczos served as assistant to albert einstein during the period of
in lanczos married maria rupp
he was offered one year visiting professorship from purdue university
for dozen years lanczos split his life between two continents
his wife maria rupp stayed with lanczos parents in sz kesfeh rv year around while lanczos went to purdue for half the year teaching graduate students matrix mechanics and tensor analysis
in his son elmar was born elmar came to lafayette indiana with his father in august just before ww ii broke out
maria was too ill to travel and died several weeks later from tuberculosis
when the nazis purged hungary of jews in of lanczos family only his sister and nephew survived
elmar married moved to seattle and raised two sons
when elmar looked at his own firstborn son he said for me it proves that hitler did not win
during the mccarthy era lanczos came under suspicion for possible communist links
in he left the and moved to the school of theoretical physics at the dublin institute for advanced studies in ireland where he succeeded erwin schr dinger and stayed until his death in in lanczos published applied analysis
the topics covered include algebraic equations matrices and eigenvalue problems large scale linear systems harmonic analysis data analysis quadrature and power expansions illustrated by numerical examples worked out in detail
the contents of the book are stylized parexic analysis lies between classical analysis and numerical analysis it is roughly the theory of approximation by finite or truncated infinite algorithms
research lanczos did pioneering work along with danielson on what is now called the fast fourier transform fft but the significance of his discovery was not appreciated at the time and today the fft is credited to cooley and tukey
as matter of fact similar claims can be made for several other mathematicians including carl friedrich gauss
lanczos was the one who introduced chebyshev polynomials to numerical computing
he discovered the diagonalizable matrix
working in washington dc at the national bureau of standards after lanczos developed number of techniques for mathematical calculations using digital computers including the lanczos algorithm for finding eigenvalues of large symmetric matrices the lanczos approximation for the gamma function the conjugate gradient method for solving systems of linear equations in lanczos showed that the weyl tensor which plays fundamental role in general relativity can be obtained from tensor potential that is now called the lanczos potential

information is an abstract concept that refers to that which has the power to inform
at the most fundamental level information pertains to the interpretation of that which may be sensed
any natural process that is not completely random and any observable pattern in any medium can be said to convey some amount of information
whereas digital signals and other data use discrete signs to convey information other phenomena and artifacts such as analog signals poems pictures music or other sounds and currents convey information in more continuous form
information is not knowledge itself but the meaning that may be derived from representation through interpretation information is often processed iteratively data available at one step are processed into information to be interpreted and processed at the next step
for example in written text each symbol or letter conveys information relevant to the word it is part of each word conveys information relevant to the phrase it is part of each phrase conveys information relevant to the sentence it is part of and so on until at the final step information is interpreted and becomes knowledge in given domain
in digital signal bits may be interpreted into the symbols letters numbers or structures that convey the information available at the next level up
the key characteristic of information is that it is subject to interpretation and processing
the concept of information is relevant in various contexts including those of constraint communication control data form education knowledge meaning understanding mental stimuli pattern perception proposition representation and entropy
the derivation of information from signal or message may be thought of as the resolution of ambiguity or uncertainty that arises during the interpretation of patterns within the signal or message information may be structured as data
redundant data can be compressed up to an optimal size which is the theoretical limit of compression
the information available through collection of data may be derived by analysis
for example data may be collected from single customer order at restaurant
the information available from many orders may be analyzed and then becomes knowledge that is put to use when the business subsequently is able to identify the most popular or least popular dish information can be transmitted in time via data storage and space via communication and telecommunication
information is expressed either as the content of message or through direct or indirect observation
that which is perceived can be construed as message in its own right and in that sense all information is always conveyed as the content of message
information can be encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation for example information may be encoded into sequence of signs or transmitted via signal
it can also be encrypted for safe storage and communication
the uncertainty of an event is measured by its probability of occurrence
uncertainty is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence
information theory takes advantage of this by concluding that more uncertain events require more information to resolve their uncertainty
the bit is typical unit of information
it is that which reduces uncertainty by half
other units such as the nat may be used
for example the information encoded in one fair coin flip is log bit and in two fair coin flips is log bits
science article estimated that of technologically stored information was already in digital bits in and that the year was the beginning of the digital age for information storage with digital storage capacity bypassing analog for the first time
etymology the english word information comes from middle french enformacion informacion information criminal investigation and its etymon latin informati conception teaching creation in english information is an uncountable mass noun
information theory information theory is the scientific study of the quantification storage and communication of information
the field was fundamentally established by the works of harry nyquist and ralph hartley in the and claude shannon in the
the field is at the intersection of probability theory statistics computer science statistical mechanics information engineering and electrical engineering
key measure in information theory is entropy
entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of random variable or the outcome of random process
for example identifying the outcome of fair coin flip with two equally likely outcomes provides less information lower entropy than specifying the outcome from roll of die with six equally likely outcomes
some other important measures in information theory are mutual information channel capacity error exponents and relative entropy
important sub fields of information theory include source coding algorithmic complexity theory algorithmic information theory and information theoretic security
there is another opinion regarding the universal definition of information
it lies in the fact that the concept itself has changed along with the change of various historical epochs and in order to find such definition it is necessary to find common features and patterns of this transformation
for example researchers in the field of information petrichenko and semenova based on retrospective analysis of changes in the concept of information give the following universal definition information is form of transmission of human experience knowledge
in their opinion the change in the essence of the concept of information occurs after various breakthrough technologies for the transfer of experience knowledge
the appearance of writing the printing press the first encyclopedias the telegraph the development of cybernetics the creation of microprocessor the internet smartphones etc
each new form of experience transfer is synthesis of the previous ones
that is why we see such variety of definitions of information because according to the law of dialectics negation negation all previous ideas about information are contained in filmed form and in its modern representation applications of fundamental topics of information theory include source coding data compression
for zip files and channel coding error detection and correction
its impact has been crucial to the success of the voyager missions to deep space the invention of the compact disc the feasibility of mobile phones and the development of the internet
the theory has also found applications in other areas including statistical inference cryptography neurobiology perception linguistics the evolution and function of molecular codes bioinformatics thermal physics quantum computing black holes information retrieval intelligence gathering plagiarism detection pattern recognition anomaly detection and even art creation
as sensory input often information can be viewed as type of input to an organism or system
inputs are of two kinds some inputs are important to the function of the organism for example food or system energy by themselves
in his book sensory ecology biophysicist david dusenbery called these causal inputs
other inputs information are important only because they are associated with causal inputs and can be used to predict the occurrence of causal input at later time and perhaps another place
some information is important because of association with other information but eventually there must be connection to causal input
in practice information is usually carried by weak stimuli that must be detected by specialized sensory systems and amplified by energy inputs before they can be functional to the organism or system
for example light is mainly but not only
plants can grow in the direction of the lightsource causal input to plants but for animals it only provides information
the colored light reflected from flower is too weak for photosynthesis but the visual system of the bee detects it and the bee nervous system uses the information to guide the bee to the flower where the bee often finds nectar or pollen which are causal inputs serving nutritional function
as representation and complexity the cognitive scientist and applied mathematician ronaldo vigo argues that information is concept that requires at least two related entities to make quantitative sense
these are any dimensionally defined category of objects and any of its subsets in essence is representation of or in other words conveys representational and hence conceptual information about vigo then defines the amount of information that conveys about as the rate of change in the complexity of whenever the objects in are removed from under vigo information pattern invariance complexity representation and information five fundamental constructs of universal science are unified under novel mathematical framework
among other things the framework aims to overcome the limitations of shannon weaver information when attempting to characterize and measure subjective information
as substitute for task wasted time energy and material michael grieves has proposed that the focus on information should be what it does as opposed to defining what it is
grieves has proposed that information can be substituted for wasted physical resources time energy and material for goal oriented tasks
goal oriented tasks can be divided into two components the most cost efficient use of physical resources time energy and material and the additional use of physical resources used by the task this second category is by definition wasted physical resources
information does not substitute or replace the most cost efficient use of physical resources but can be used to replace the wasted physical resources
the condition that this occurs under is that the cost of information is less than the cost of the wasted physical resources
since information is non rival good this can be especially beneficial for repeatable tasks
in manufacturing the task category of the most cost efficient use of physical resources is called lean manufacturing
as an influence that leads to transformation information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns
in this sense there is no need for conscious mind to perceive much less appreciate the pattern
consider for example dna
the sequence of nucleotides is pattern that influences the formation and development of an organism without any need for conscious mind
one might argue though that for human to consciously define pattern for example nucleotide naturally involves conscious information processing
systems theory at times seems to refer to information in this sense assuming information does not necessarily involve any conscious mind and patterns circulating due to feedback in the system can be called information
in other words it can be said that information in this sense is something potentially perceived as representation though not created or presented for that purpose
for example gregory bateson defines information as difference that makes difference if however the premise of influence implies that information has been perceived by conscious mind and also interpreted by it the specific context associated with this interpretation may cause the transformation of the information into knowledge
complex definitions of both information and knowledge make such semantic and logical analysis difficult but the condition of transformation is an important point in the study of information as it relates to knowledge especially in the business discipline of knowledge management
in this practice tools and processes are used to assist knowledge worker in performing research and making decisions including steps such as review information to effectively derive value and meaning reference metadata if available establish relevant context often from many possible contexts derive new knowledge from the information make decisions or recommendations from the resulting knowledgestewart argues that transformation of information into knowledge is critical lying at the core of value creation and competitive advantage for the modern enterprise
the danish dictionary of information terms argues that information only provides an answer to posed question
whether the answer provides knowledge depends on the informed person
so generalized definition of the concept should be information an answer to specific question
when marshall mcluhan speaks of media and their effects on human cultures he refers to the structure of artifacts that in turn shape our behaviors and mindsets
also pheromones are often said to be information in this sense
technologically mediated information these sections are using measurements of data rather than information as information cannot be directly measured
as of it is estimated that the world technological capacity to store information grew from optimally compressed exabytes in which is the informational equivalent to less than one mb cd rom per person mb per person to optimally compressed exabytes in this is the informational equivalent of almost cd rom per person in the world combined technological capacity to receive information through one way broadcast networks was the informational equivalent of newspapers per person per day in the world combined effective capacity to exchange information through two way telecommunication networks was the informational equivalent of newspapers per person per day in as of an estimated of all new information is digital mostly stored on hard drives
as of the total amount of data created captured copied and consumed globally is forecast to increase rapidly reaching zettabytes in over the next five years up to global data creation is projected to grow to more than zettabytes
as records records are specialized forms of information
essentially records are information produced consciously or as by products of business activities or transactions and retained because of their value
primarily their value is as evidence of the activities of the organization but they may also be retained for their informational value
sound records management ensures that the integrity of records is preserved for as long as they are required
the international standard on records management iso defines records as information created received and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business
the international committee on archives ica committee on electronic records defined record as recorded information produced or received in the initiation conduct or completion of an institutional or individual activity and that comprises content context and structure sufficient to provide evidence of the activity records may be maintained to retain corporate memory of the organization or to meet legal fiscal or accountability requirements imposed on the organization
willis expressed the view that sound management of business records and information delivered six key requirements for good corporate governance transparency accountability due process compliance meeting statutory and common law requirements and security of personal and corporate information
semiotics michael buckland has classified information in terms of its uses information as process information as knowledge and information as thing beynon davies explains the multi faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal sign systems
signs themselves can be considered in terms of four inter dependent levels layers or branches of semiotics pragmatics semantics syntax and empirics
these four layers serve to connect the social world on the one hand with the physical or technical world on the other
pragmatics is concerned with the purpose of communication
pragmatics links the issue of signs with the context within which signs are used
the focus of pragmatics is on the intentions of living agents underlying communicative behaviour
in other words pragmatics link language to action
semantics is concerned with the meaning of message conveyed in communicative act
semantics considers the content of communication
semantics is the study of the meaning of signs the association between signs and behaviour
semantics can be considered as the study of the link between symbols and their referents or concepts particularly the way that signs relate to human behavior
syntax is concerned with the formalism used to represent message
syntax as an area studies the form of communication in terms of the logic and grammar of sign systems
syntax is devoted to the study of the form rather than the content of signs and sign systems
nielsen discusses the relationship between semiotics and information in relation to dictionaries
he introduces the concept of lexicographic information costs and refers to the effort user of dictionary must make to first find and then understand data so that they can generate information
communication normally exists within the context of some social situation
the social situation sets the context for the intentions conveyed pragmatics and the form of communication
in communicative situation intentions are expressed through messages that comprise collections of inter related signs taken from language mutually understood by the agents involved in the communication
mutual understanding implies that agents involved understand the chosen language in terms of its agreed syntax syntactics and semantics
the sender codes the message in the language and sends the message as signals along some communication channel empirics
the chosen communication channel has inherent properties that determine outcomes such as the speed at which communication can take place and over what distance
the application of information study the information cycle addressed as whole or in its distinct components is of great concern to information technology information systems as well as information science
these fields deal with those processes and techniques pertaining to information capture through sensors and generation through computation formulation or composition processing including encoding encryption compression packaging transmission including all telecommunication methods presentation including visualization display methods storage such as magnetic or optical including holographic methods etc

information security shortened as infosec is the ongoing process of exercising due diligence to protect information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure destruction modification disruption or distribution through algorithms and procedures focused on monitoring and detection as well as incident response and repair
information analysis is the process of inspecting transforming and modelling information by converting raw data into actionable knowledge in support of the decision making process
information quality shortened as infoq is the potential of dataset to achieve specific scientific or practical goal using given empirical analysis method

the sample mean or empirical mean and the sample covariance are statistics computed from sample of data on one or more random variables
the sample mean is the average value or mean value of sample of numbers taken from larger population of numbers where population indicates not number of people but the entirety of relevant data whether collected or not
sample of companies sales from the fortune might be used for convenience instead of looking at the population all companies sales
the sample mean is used as an estimator for the population mean the average value in the entire population where the estimate is more likely to be close to the population mean if the sample is large and representative
the reliability of the sample mean is estimated using the standard error which in turn is calculated using the variance of the sample
if the sample is random the standard error falls with the size of the sample and the sample mean distribution approaches the normal distribution as the sample size increases
the term sample mean can also be used to refer to vector of average values when the statistician is looking at the values of several variables in the sample

in this case there is not just sample variance for each variable but sample variance covariance matrix or simply covariance matrix showing also the relationship between each pair of variables
this would be matrix when variables are being considered
the sample covariance is useful in judging the reliability of the sample means as estimators and is also useful as an estimate of the population covariance matrix
due to their ease of calculation and other desirable characteristics the sample mean and sample covariance are widely used in statistics to represent the location and dispersion of the distribution of values in the sample and to estimate the values for the population
definition of the sample mean the sample mean is the average of the values of variable in sample which is the sum of those values divided by the number of values
using mathematical notation if sample of observations on variable is taken from the population the sample mean is under this definition if the sample is taken from the population then the sample mean is as compared to the population mean of even if sample is random it is rarely perfectly representative and other samples would have other sample means even if the samples were all from the same population
the sample for example would have sample mean of if the statistician is interested in variables rather than one each observation having value for each of those variables the overall sample mean consists of sample means for individual variables
let be the ith independently drawn observation on the jth random variable
these observations can be arranged into column vectors each with entries with the column vector giving the th observations of all variables being denoted
the sample mean vector is column vector whose th element is the average value of the observations of the jth variable thus the sample mean vector contains the average of the observations for each variable and is written definition of sample covariance the sample covariance matrix is by matrix with entries where is an estimate of the covariance between the jth variable and the kth variable of the population underlying the data
in terms of the observation vectors the sample covariance is
alternatively arranging the observation vectors as the columns of matrix so that which is matrix of rows and columns
here the sample covariance matrix can be computed as where is an by vector of ones
if the observations are arranged as rows instead of columns so is now row vector and is an matrix whose column is the vector of observations on variable then applying transposes in the appropriate places yields
like covariance matrices for random vector sample covariance matrices are positive semi definite
to prove it note that for any matrix the matrix is positive semi definite
furthermore covariance matrix is positive definite if and only if the rank of the
vectors is unbiasedness the sample mean and the sample covariance matrix are unbiased estimates of the mean and the covariance matrix of the random vector row vector whose jth element is one of the random variables
the sample covariance matrix has in the denominator rather than due to variant of bessel correction in short the sample covariance relies on the difference between each observation and the sample mean but the sample mean is slightly correlated with each observation since it is defined in terms of all observations
if the population mean is known the analogous unbiased estimate using the population mean has in the denominator
this is an example of why in probability and statistics it is essential to distinguish between random variables upper case letters and realizations of the random variables lower case letters
the maximum likelihood estimate of the covariance for the gaussian distribution case has in the denominator as well
the ratio of to approaches for large so the maximum likelihood estimate approximately equals the unbiased estimate when the sample is large
distribution of the sample mean for each random variable the sample mean is good estimator of the population mean where good estimator is defined as being efficient and unbiased
of course the estimator will likely not be the true value of the population mean since different samples drawn from the same distribution will give different sample means and hence different estimates of the true mean
thus the sample mean is random variable not constant and consequently has its own distribution
for random sample of observations on the jth random variable the sample mean distribution itself has mean equal to the population mean and variance equal to where is the population variance
the arithmetic mean of population or population mean is often denoted the sample mean the arithmetic mean of sample of values drawn from the population makes good estimator of the population mean as its expected value is equal to the population mean that is it is an unbiased estimator
the sample mean is random variable not constant since its calculated value will randomly differ depending on which members of the population are sampled and consequently it will have its own distribution
for random sample of independent observations the expected value of the sample mean is and the variance of the sample mean is var if the samples are not independent but correlated then special care has to be taken in order to avoid the problem of pseudoreplication
if the population is normally distributed then the sample mean is normally distributed as follows
if the population is not normally distributed the sample mean is nonetheless approximately normally distributed if is large and
this is consequence of the central limit theorem
weighted samples in weighted sample each vector each set of single observations on each of the random variables is assigned weight without loss of generality assume that the weights are normalized

if all weights are the same the weighted mean and covariance reduce to the biased sample mean and covariance mentioned above
criticism the sample mean and sample covariance are not robust statistics meaning that they are sensitive to outliers
as robustness is often desired trait particularly in real world applications robust alternatives may prove desirable notably quantile based statistics such as the sample median for location and interquartile range iqr for dispersion

the sample mean or empirical mean and the sample covariance are statistics computed from sample of data on one or more random variables
the sample mean is the average value or mean value of sample of numbers taken from larger population of numbers where population indicates not number of people but the entirety of relevant data whether collected or not
sample of companies sales from the fortune might be used for convenience instead of looking at the population all companies sales
the sample mean is used as an estimator for the population mean the average value in the entire population where the estimate is more likely to be close to the population mean if the sample is large and representative
the reliability of the sample mean is estimated using the standard error which in turn is calculated using the variance of the sample
if the sample is random the standard error falls with the size of the sample and the sample mean distribution approaches the normal distribution as the sample size increases
the term sample mean can also be used to refer to vector of average values when the statistician is looking at the values of several variables in the sample

viktor amazaspovich ambartsumian russian armenian viktor hamazaspi hambardzumyan september
september august was soviet armenian astrophysicist and science administrator
one of the th century top astronomers he is widely regarded as the founder of theoretical astrophysics in the soviet union
educated at leningrad state university lsu and the pulkovo observatory ambartsumian taught at lsu and founded the soviet union first department of astrophysics there in he subsequently moved to soviet armenia where he founded the byurakan observatory in it became his institutional base for the decades to come and major center of astronomical research
he also co founded the armenian academy of sciences and led it for almost half century the entire post war period
one commentator noted that science in armenia was synonymous with the name ambartsumian
in ambartsumian founded the journal astrofizika and served as its editor for over years
ambartsumian began retiring from the various positions he held only from the age of he died at his house in byurakan and was buried on the grounds of the observatory
he was declared national hero of armenia in
background ambartsumian was born in tiflis on september september in old style to hripsime khakhanian and hamazasp hambardzumyan
hripsime father was an armenian apostolic priest from tskhinvali while hamazasp hailed from vardenis basargechar
his ancestors moved from diyadin what is now turkey to the southern shores of lake sevan in in the aftermath of the russo turkish war
hamazasp russified amazasp was an educated man of letters who studied law at saint petersburg university
he was also writer and translator and notably translated homer iliad into armenian from classical greek
in he co founded the caucasian society of armenian writers which lasted until ambartsumian was the secretary while hovhannes tumanyan the famed poet served as its president ambartsumian parents married in he had brother levon and sister gohar
his brother geophysics student died at while on an expedition in the urals
gohar was mathematician and chair of probability theory and mathematical statistics at yerevan state university towards the end of her life
education ambartsumian developed an early interest in mathematics and was able to multiply by the age of his interest in astronomy began with reading russian translation of book by ormsby mitchel at according to himself he became an astronomer at the age of between and he studied at tiflis gymnasiums and where schooling was done in both russian and armenian
in he transferred to gymnasium to study under nikolay ignatievich sudakov moscow educated astronomer whom ambartsumian called very serious teacher of astronomy
ambartsumian worked with sudakov at the school observatory the latter had built
at school ambartsumian wrote several papers on astronomy and delivered lectures on the origin of the solar system and extraterrestrial life at first in school and then in the various clubs and houses of culture beginning at
in ambartsumian delivered lecture at yerevan state university about the theory of relativity
he also met ashot hovhannisyan and alexander miasnikian armenia communist leaders in ambartsumian moved to leningrad where he began attending the herzen pedagogical institute
according to shakhbazyan it was his non peasant and non proletarian background that kept him from attending leningrad state university lsu
however in an interview ambartsumian stated that it was too late for him to apply to lsu because he arrived in august and admissions were already closed
not to lose year he instead enrolled in the physics and mathematics department at the pedagogical institute
after year he transferred to lsu department of physics and mathematics
at university ambartsumian was interested in both astronomy and mathematics
loved mathematics but at the same time felt that my profession would be astronomy
mathematics was like hobby but did complete the full mathematics curriculum
thus you could say that graduated with major in mathematics but in fact it is recorded that graduated as an astronomer he said in an interview in at lsu among his professors were the physicist orest khvolson and mathematician vladimir smirnov
he studied alongside other major soviet scientists such as lev landau sergei sobolev sergey khristianovich and george gamow
in he published the first of his scholarly papers as student
he graduated in although he received his diploma only fifty years later in his undergraduate thesis was devoted to study of radiative transfer radiative equilibrium
he completed his postgraduate studies at the pulkovo observatory under aristarkh belopolsky between and
career leningrad after completing his postgraduate studies in ambartsumian began working at the pulkovo observatory and teaching part time at lsu
in ambartsumian began reading the first course on theoretical astrophysics in the soviet union
he also served as pulkovo scientific secretary in which involved mostly administrative work
ambartsumian later characterized pulkovo as being very old institution and for this reason there were certain elements of ossification and stagnation
nevertheless this was the best qualified astronomical institution in the soviet union
in ambartsumian was fired by pulkovo director boris gerasimovich for alleged laziness
gerasimovich viewed ambartsumian and other young astrophysicists as undisciplined and in too much of rush to publish untested theories and poorly documented research
gerasimovich himself had tendency to non cooperativeness
gerasimovich was not taken seriously by them
when in subrahmanyan chandrasekhar visited leningrad he was told by ambartsumian look here here is set of papers by gerasimovich
turn to an arbitrary paper and to an arbitrary line
am sure you will find mistake
chandrasekhar stated in that during his visit in ambartsumian was very free and very open
he was extremely critical of his seniors
after leaving pulkovo ambartsumian founded the first department of astrophysics in the soviet union at leningrad state university in in he was named professor at lsu and in he was named doctor of physical mathematical sciences without having to defend thesis based on his scientific work through that date
he headed the department until or between and ambartsumian was the director of the astronomical observatory of lsu
he was simultaneously prorector deputy president of the university
among his graduate students were viktor sobolev benjamin markarian grigor gurzadyan and others
ambartsumian considered sobolev his most brilliant graduate student
stalin purgesmany of ambartsumian colleagues and friends suffered during the great purge under stalin most notably nikolai aleksandrovich kozyrev with whom he became close friends in the mid
kozyrev was sentenced to ten years in forced labor camp but survived the repressions
others such as matvei petrovich bronstein and pulkovo director boris gerasimovich did not survive
ambartsumian relations with kozyrev were strained for the remainder of his life
mccutcheon notes that while in the west some have questioned ambartsumian possible role in the terror there is no hard evidence to suggest that he was guilty of anything more serious than surviving at time when others did not
world war iiambartsumian led the evacuation of part of the faculty of leningrad state university to elabuga yelabuga tatarstan in after the nazi invasion of the soviet union
there branch of lsu operated under ambartsumian leadership until he served as the dean of the branch
armenia in ambartsumian moved with his family to yerevan soviet armenia where he lived until the end of his life
in the same year he co founded the armenian academy of sciences along with scientists and scholars hovsep orbeli hrachia acharian artem alikhanian abram alikhanov manuk abeghian and others
he served as vice president of the academy until and as president from to since ambartsumian served as director of the yerevan astronomical observatory
the small observatory was affiliated with yerevan state university
ambartsumian had secured nine inch telescope from leningrad for the observatory
ambartsumian said that before the war this observatory did not rise significantly above the level of amateur variable star observations
during the war they also carried out photographic observations of variable stars using small camera
in ambartsumian founded the department of astrophysicists at yerevan state university ysu
he was named professor of astrophysics at ysu in he served as chair of the department until in ambartsumian founded the journal astrofizika armenian russian which has been published by the armenian academy of sciences since then
it was originally published in russian subsequently articles in english began to appear
he served as its editor in chief until the journal has also been published since the first issue in english by springer in the us as astrophysics
byurakan in ambartsumian founded the byurakan astrophysical observatory in the village of byurakan at an altitude of ft on the slopes of mount aragats some km mi from yerevan
the first buildings were completed in though the official inauguration took place in observations began to be carried out simultaneous with the construction of the observatory
our instruments stood under the open sky covered with tarpaulin said ambartsumian
ambartsumian initially lived at house in the village of byurakan then build house within the observatory grounds with the money awarded with the stalin prize
ambartsumian directed the byurakan observatory until and was named its honorary director that year
from until his death in the byurakan observatory served as ambartsumian institutional base
in ambartsumian secured schmidt telescope with cm correcting plate and cm mirror for byurakan
the telescope was reportedly made by carl zeiss ag in nazi germany in the and was transferred to leningrad as spoils of war
it was completed in leningrad and sent to armenia
beginning with on ambartsumian initiative benjamin markarian started the first byurakan survey that resulted in the discovery of the markarian galaxies
number of international symposiums and meetings were held at byurakan under ambartsumian supervision
in the observatory was awarded the order of lenin the soviet union highest civilian order for its great merit to the development of science
in ambartsumian supervised the establishment of an astrophysical station of leningrad state university his alma mater within the grounds of the byurakan observatory
it is where graduate students of the lsu did their summer internships until the late
it was shut down in ambartsumian and his disciples at the byurakan observatory became known in the scholarly literature as the byurakan school
from to ambartsumian headed specialized council for theses defenses at byurakan
over scientists defended their phd candidate and doctoral theses on astronomy astrophysics and theoretical physics in those years under ambartsumian
though most of the students were graduates of the astrophysics department of yerevan state university many came from russia georgia ukraine azerbaijan hungary bulgaria and elsewhere
several symposiums of the international astronomical union and numerous conferences were held in byurakan in attendance of jan oort fritz zwicky subrahmanyan chandrasekhar pyotr kapitsa vitaly ginzburg and others
it was also visited by soviet leaders nikita khrushchev and leonid brezhnev with the byurakan observatory ambartsumian put armenia on the astronomical map and made soviet armenia one of the world centers for the study of astrophysics
by the time of his death in the new york times described byurakan as one of the world leading astronomical research centers
as of the byurakan observatory maintained regular contact with research institutions and with scientists from countries
research ambartsumian carried out basic research in astronomy and cosmogony
his research covered astrophysics theoretical physics and mathematical physics
most of his research focused on physics of nebulae star systems and extragalactic astronomy
he is best known for having discovered stellar associations and predicted activity of galactic nuclei
in his later career ambartsumian held views in contradiction to the consequences of the general relativity such as rejecting the existence of black holes
stellar associations in ambartsumian discovered stellar associations new type of stellar system which led to the conclusion that star formation continues to take place in the milky way galaxy
at the time the idea of star formation as an ongoing process was regarded as very speculative
his discovery was announced in short publication by the armenian academy sciences
ambartsumian discovery was based on his observation of stars of and spectral types and tauri and flare stars that cluster very loosely
this is significantly different from open clusters which have higher density of stars while stellar associations have lower than average density
ambartsumian divided stellar associations into ob and groups and concluded that the associations have to be dynamically unstable configurations and must expand subsequently dissolving to form field stars
he thus argued that star forming is ongoing in the galaxy and that stars are born explosively and in groups ambartsumian concept was not immediately accepted
chandrasekhar noted the early scepticism with which this discovery was received by the astronomers of the establishment when first gave an account of ambartsumian paper at the colloquium at the yerkes observatory in late
chandrasekhar noted that ambartsumian discovery of stellar associations had far reaching implications for subsequent theories relating to star formation
mccutcheon noted that the discovery opened an entirely new field of astrophysical research
active galactic nuclei agn ambartsumian began studying nuclei of galaxies in the mid
he found that clusters of galaxies are unstable and that galaxy formation is still ongoing
at the solvay conference on physics in brussels he gave famous lecture in which he claimed enormous explosions take place in galactic nuclei and as result huge amount of mass is expelled
in addition if this is so these galactic nuclei must contain bodies of huge mass and unknown nature
ambartsumian report essentially introduced active galactic nucleus agn as major theory of galactic evolution
the concept of agn was widely accepted some years later
astronomy from space ambartsumian was pioneer of astronomical research from soviet spacecraft
the program was directed by his disciple grigor gurzadyan and was launched in in april the salyut space station carried orion the first space telescope with an objective prism into orbit
in december the manned soyuz mission operated the orion ultraviolet cassegrain telescope with quartz objective prism built in the byurakan observatory
spectra of thousands of stars to as faint as thirteenth magnitude were obtained as was the first satellite ultraviolet spectrogram of planetary nebula revealing lines of aluminium and titanium elements not previously observed in planetary nebulae
these activities especially the space missions when for example special manned spaceship had to be devoted to an experiment from the smallest soviet republic needed powerful backing both in kremlin corridors and within the top secret rocket industry establishment
this was achieved due to ambartsumian political skills with the active support of mstislav keldish the then president of the academy of sciences of the ussr
mathematics ambartsumian also made contributions to mathematics most notably with his paper in zeitschrift physik
in it ambartsumian first introduced the inverse sturm liouville problem
he proved that among all vibrating strings only the homogeneous vibrating string has eigenvalues that are specific to it that is homogeneous vibrating strings have spectrum of eigenvalues
it was only in the mid when his paper received attention and became significant research topic in the ensuing decades
he commented when an astronomer is publishing mathematical paper in physical journal he cannot expect to attract too many readers
science administration soviet academy of sciences ambartsumian was elected corresponding member of the ussr academy of sciences in and full member academician in in he became member of the academy presidium the governing body
he also chaired the academy joint coordinating scientific council on astronomy which was responsible for the priorities and all major decisions in all of astronomy
he was also chairman of the academy commissions on astronomy and cosmogony in these positions ambartsumian was one of the most powerful scientists of his time
mccutcheon noted that ambartsumian towering authority as an astrophysicist combined with his position in the soviet establishment made him arguably the most powerful soviet astronomer of his day
he was often the official head of soviet delegations at many conferences not only on astronomy but also on natural philosophy
from to ambartsumian was member of the editorial board of astronomicheskii zhurnal also known as astronomy reports the soviet union main astronomy journal
he was also on the editorial board of doklady akademii nauk sssr proceedings of the ussr academy of sciences
armenian academy of sciences although the armenian branch of the soviet academy of sciences was established in it was not until that the national academy of sciences of the armenian ssr was founded
ambartsumian was one of its original co founders along with other prominent scholars and scientists including hovsep orbeli who became its first president
ambartsumian initially served as vice president and in he became the academy second president serving for years until when he stepped down in he was declared honorary president of the academy rouben paul adalian wrote that ambartsumian exercised enormous influence in the advancement of science in soviet armenia and was revered as his country leading scientist
mccutcheon went on to note that from that point forward science in armenia was synonymous with the name ambartsumian
as president of the principal coordinating body for scientific research in soviet armenia ambartsumian played significant role in promoting the sciences in the country
he actively promoted the natural and exact sciences including physics and mathematics radioelectronics chemistry mechanics and engineering
artashes shahinian noted that ambartsumian played significant role in the development of the physical and mathematical sciences
he played an instrumental role in the establishment and development of the yerevan scientific research institute of mathematical machines yerniimm in popularly known as the mergelyan institute after its first director mathematician sergey mergelyan
apoyan rejects that ambartsumian had direct involvement in its creation and characterizes his role as favorable neutrality
overall apoyan criticizes ambartsumian role in science administration
he wrote that he had tendency to fail projects that did not directly serve his fame
he went as far as call ambartsumian role similar to that of tyrant
ambartsumian and mergelyan had complicated relationship
in ambartsumian persuaded him to return to armenia from moscow and become vice president of the armenian academy of sciences
however in mergelyan was not reelected to the presidium of the academy and was forced to leave it
some academicians called for revote but ambartsumian rejected any such attempts
oganjanyan and silantiev note that ambartsumian was rumored to have seen mergelyan as rival for the academy president and decided to get rid of the competitor forever
ambartsumian was the chairman of the editorial board of the armenian soviet encyclopedia haykakan sovetakan hanragitaran published in volumes in
supplementary volume devoted to soviet armenia was published in works on the encyclopedia began in although it reflected the government marxist leninist viewpoint is in the most comprehensive encyclopedia in the armenian language to this day
each volume was published in copies
international according to jean claude pecker ambartsumian had very strong influence on world astropolitics and is one of the few astronomers who have had such deep influence on the life of the international bodies devoted to the promotion and defense of astronomy and science in general
international astronomical unionambartsumian was member of the international astronomical union iau since he served as vice president of the iau from to then as president from to as vice president ambartsumian attempted to have the iau general assembly be held in leningrad in however the iau executive committee canceled the assembly increasing tensions within the iau
an iau general assembly eventually took place in moscow in ambartsumian headed the organizing committee
blaauw noted that during these years ambartsumian although violently opposing the iau policy remained loyal to the executive committee majority decisions for the sake of safeguarding international collaboration an attitude that contributed to his election as president of the iau in
he continued to support it as the world wide organization embracing astronomers from all countries
his election as president of the iau in reflected both the appreciation for his efforts in this respect and his outstanding scientific achievements
ambartsumian was outspoken about the importance of international cooperation
at the iau general assembly in rome he declared we believe that the joint study of such large problems as that of the evolution of celestial bodies will contribute to the cultural rapprochement of different nations and to better understanding among them
this is our modest contribution to the noble efforts toward maintaining peace throughout the world
at the iau symposium in sydney he stated that while competition between nations is important it should be associated with co operation
international council of scientific unionsambartsumian also served as president of the international council of scientific unions icsu between and being elected twice for two year terms in and he was the first individual from the eastern bloc to be elected to that post
philosophical and cosmological views ambartsumian published several books and articles on philosophy including philosophical questions about the science of the universe
in paper ambartsumian wrote that he believes in close collaboration of philosophy and the natural sciences to solve the main scientific problems about nature
ambartsumian became member of the administration of the philosophical society of the soviet union when it was established in in he became honorary president of the philosophical society of armenia which was created through his efforts
science and religion ambartsumian was an atheist and believed that science and religion are irreconcilable
ambartsumian wrote in for over four decades he headed gitelik the armenian branch of the all soviet organization znaniye knowledge founded in to continue the pre war atheist work of the league of militant godless
it published atheist novels and journals produced films and organized lectures on the supremacy of science over religion
the organization engaged in what it called scientific atheistic propaganda
despite his atheism ambartsumian reportedly felt that christianity has been important in preserving armenian identity
according to one associate ambartsumian self identified as an armenian christian but was not religious
ambartsumian had friendly relations with vazgen the long time head catholicos of the armenian apostolic church especially since at least the late
in ambartsumian visited san lazzaro degli armeni in venice home of the armenian catholic congregation of the mekhitarists and was declared an honorary member of the san lazzaro armenian academy that year
marxism leninism and dialectical materialism ambartsumian accepted and followed marxist leninist philosophy and staunchly promoted dialectical materialism and projected it on his astrophysical interpretations
helge kragh described ambartsumian as convinced marxist
he wrote on marxism leninism and dialectical materialism in dialectical materialism influenced ambartsumian cosmological views and ideas
according to loren graham perhaps no great soviet scientist has made more outspoken statements in favor of dialectical materialism than ambartsumian
mark teeter wrote in report that ambartsumian is one of rather limited group of soviet scholars of international stature who claim that dialectical materialism has assisted them in their work
kragh noted that ambartsumian was not cosmologist but an astrophysicist and that his ideas of the universe were influenced both by his background in astrophysics and his adherence to marxist leninist philosophy
graham notes that his praise of dialectical materialism has been voiced again and again over the years these affirmations have come when political controls were rather lax as well as when they were tight
we have every reason to believe that they reflect at root his own approach to nature
political career and views ambartsumian is often referred to as politician donald lynden bell called him skillful one
in interview subrahmanyan chandrasekhar went as far as to opine that ambartsumian has been much more of politician than an astronomer since the mid lyudvig mirzoyan colleague and friend wrote that ambartsumian was true patriot of his native land soviet armenia and all the soviet union and simultaneously he was convinced internationalist
he was described by us based soviet government printed magazine as an ardent advocate of the widest possible international scientific exchange
soviet politics mccutcheon noted that ambartsumian life was shaped and directed by the soviet system and he was politically loyal to the soviet authorities
loren graham noted that at the same time ambartsumian was not afraid to reprimand the communist party ideologues when they obstructed his research
ronald doel noted that ambartsumian was in favor with the communist party and enjoyed the freedom to travel to the west
adriaan blaauw wrote that his political views harmonized to considerable degree with those of soviet rulers
mccutcheon wrote the following on his relationship with the soviet system ambartsumian jointed the communist party of the soviet union cpsu in in he became member of the central committee the executive branch of the communist party of the armenian ssr
ambartsumian was also member of the supreme soviet from to rd to th convocation sessions
in he was elected as representative from armenia to the congress of people deputies of the soviet union in the first relatively free elections ambartsumian was delegate to the th th nd rd th th and th congresses of the cpsu
cold war politics ambartsumian often signed open letters in support of the official line of the soviet authorities
in he was among leading soviet scientists who signed letter to president richard nixon in support of black militant communist angela davis and appealed him to give her an opportunity of continuing her scientific work
in ambartsumian was among soviet scientists who signed statement attacking president ronald reagan strategic defense initiative star wars namely reagan plan for an effective defense against nuclear attack
the scientists stated that reagan is creating most dangerous illusion that may turn into an even more threatening spiral of the arms race
ambartsumian relationship with dissidents was complicated
in he refused to meet yuri orlov nuclear physicist and prominent dissident after having offered him job in yerevan
ambartsumian told him through subordinate that there are situations when even an academy member is helpless
in he was among soviet scientists who denounced the award of the nobel peace prize to soviet physicist and dissident andrei sakharov
armenian causes ambartsumian revered the armenian language and supported its usage
he insisted all internal communication of the armenian academy of sciences be done in armenian when he became president in as president of the armenian academy of sciences ambartsumian often gave speeches at major events such as during the commemorations of the th anniversary of mesrop mashtots the inventor of the armenian alphabet in and the th anniversary of hovhannes tumanyan armenia national poet in
armenian genocide ambartsumian delivered speech on april on the th anniversary of the armenian genocide describing it as extermination of the armenian population of western armenia
he linked it to the th anniversary of soviet armenia and the revival of the armenian people as result of the october revolution
in an article published in pravda on april ambartsumian linked the armenian genocide to the holocaust and blamed german imperialism during world war for inspiring the young turks and the capitalist states for failing to defend the innocent armenian population and praised the october revolution for saving the armenian nation
nagorno karabakh in november the armenian academy of sciences led by ambartsumian issued statement protesting the decision of the supreme soviet of the soviet union to return nagorno karabakh to the direct jurisdiction of soviet azerbaijan in september ambartsumian and four other armenians including writer zori balayan and actor sos sargsyan went on hunger strike at the hotel moskva in moscow to protest the military rule over nagorno karabakh declared by mikhail gorbachev
ambartsumian celebrated his nd birthday hunger striking
he insisted that gorbachev had violated the soviet constitution by keeping nagorno karabakh under direct rule from moscow
this is bad thing when government does not abide by its own laws he argued
he also stated my desire is that karabakh be part of armenia
this is problem that has to be solved with long process and with concessions
ambartsumian stated that his only demand is that the elected leaders of nagorno karabakh regain control
ambartsumian called the hunger strike modest step aimed at making huge resonance in the world to let the world know
the soviet authorities totally ignored the strike
he ended it after days only when catholicos vazgen persuaded him to do so on may ambartsumian and number of members of the armenian academy of sciences wrote letter to soviet president mikhail gorbachev expressing their concern with the forced expulsion of ethnic armenians from parts of nkao and shahumian rayon as part of operation ring
soviet collapse and independence of armenia in june the session of the armenian academy of sciences issued statement on its views on armenian independence and the future of the soviet union
the academy stated its unconditional support for the independence of armenia pushed at the time by the pan armenian national movement hhsh
however it argued that because armenia is economically interconnected with and dependent on other soviet republics an abrupt disruption in the existing relations would result in unimaginable levels of economic collapse unemployment and emigration
thus they called for armenia to join the new union treaty proposed by gorbachev
the session also argued that leaving the soviet union would mean to abandon nagorno karabakh as communist ambartsumian reportedly regretted the collapse of the soviet union but voted for armenia independence in the referendum
he appreciated independent armenia but reminded armenians that they will be paying high price for it
in he congratulated armenians worldwide with armenia independence and stated that the newly independent republic is moving forward
according to yuri shahbazyan friend and biographer of ambartsumian he remained sympathetic towards the communist party of russia and was critical of western sponsored economic liberalization in russia and other post soviet countries
personal life when ambartsumian was referred to by foreigners as russian scientist he corrected them by saying he was armenian
he spoke perfect armenian albeit with an accent between and ambartsumian mostly divided his time between yerevan and byurakan
he built himself house within the byurakan observatory with the award money that came with his second stalin prize in since he also maintained house next to the building of the academy of sciences in yerevan on baghramyan avenue
personality donald lynden bell characterized ambartsumian as broad shouldered thickset man of medium height quick intellect and strong character
lynden bell and vahe gurzadyan wrote that ambartsumian was modest in private life and behaved simply in public
fadey sargsyan described ambartsumian as an extremely modest man
anthony astrachan wrote in the new yorker that ambartsumian is by all reports an engaging human being
ambartsumian admitted to not having any hobbies my only passion is science astronomy
like jealous wife it expects man to give all of himself
however he loved poetry and music and could enliven even the most abstract mathematical lectures with quotations from classical and contemporary poets
family in or ambartsumian married vera fyodorovna klochikhina an ethnic russian who was the niece and the adopted daughter of pelageya shajn the wife of grigory shajn both russian astronomers
she was an english teacher who taught him to read his papers in english when he visited the and britain
however she could not reconcile with his barbarous pronunciation as she described it
he was deeply depressed by her death in they had four children daughters karine
all four became either mathematicians or physicists
as of he had eight grandchildren
retirement and death ambartsumian began retiring from the various positions he held in at he left the position of the director of the byurakan observatory that year
in he stepped down as president of the armenian academy of sciences and in as chair of astrophysics at yerevan state university ambartsumian died at his house at the byurakan observatory complex on august month before his th birthday
the house was opened as his museum in august he was buried at the observatory grounds next to his wife and parents
his funeral was attended by thousands of people including armenia president levon ter petrosyan
recognition ambartsumian was one of the leading astrophysicists and astronomers of the th century
in subrahmanyan chandrasekhar stated my own impression has always been that he was when he was in his prime one of the most perceptive and elegant of astronomers
chandrasekhar wrote in ambartsumian was arguably the leading astronomer of the soviet union and is universally recognized as the founder of the soviet school of theoretical astrophysics
he was also well regarded internationally
loren graham called him one of the best known abroad of all soviet scientists
he was an honorary or foreign member of academies of sciences of over countries despite being soviet scientist he was well regarded in the united states
during the cold war ambartsumian was the first soviet scientist to become foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences and foreign associate of the national academy of sciences in and respectively
in january ambartsumian was invited to the house committee on science and astronautics where he was introduced by fred lawrence whipple as man who is rated the world greatest astronomer or at least among the very greatest
in armenia ambartsumian is recognized as the greatest scientist in th century armenia
he is considered the greatest armenian scientist since anania shirakatsi the seventh century astronomer
fadey sargsyan ambartsumian successor as president of the armenian academy of sciences stated in that ambartsumian is one of those scientists who in his merits and reputation goes beyond the limits of his scientific fields and in his own lifetime becomes great national figure
he can truly be called great armenian
on october armenia president levon ter petrosyan awarded ambartsumian the title of national hero of armenia for his scientific work of international significance science administration and patriotic activism
his official obituary was signed by armenia president government and parliament
tribute an asteroid discovered at the crimean astrophysical observatory in by tamara smirnova is named ambartsumian in ambartsumian th anniversary was celebrated in armenia the international astronomical union held symposium at the byurakan observatory and the central bank of armenia issued dram banknote depicting ambartsumian and the byurakan observatory

in linear algebra the rank of matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated or spanned by its columns
this corresponds to the maximal number of linearly independent columns of this in turn is identical to the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows
rank is thus measure of the nondegenerateness of the system of linear equations and linear transformation encoded by there are multiple equivalent definitions of rank
matrix rank is one of its most fundamental characteristics
the rank is commonly denoted by rank or rk sometimes the parentheses are not written as in rank
main definitions in this section we give some definitions of the rank of matrix
many definitions are possible see alternative definitions for several of these
the column rank of is the dimension of the column space of while the row rank of is the dimension of the row space of fundamental result in linear algebra is that the column rank and the row rank are always equal
two proofs of this result are given in proofs that column rank row rank below
this number the number of linearly independent rows or columns is simply called the rank of matrix is said to have full rank if its rank equals the largest possible for matrix of the same dimensions which is the lesser of the number of rows and columns
matrix is said to be rank deficient if it does not have full rank
the rank deficiency of matrix is the difference between the lesser of the number of rows and columns and the rank
the rank of linear map or operator is defined as the dimension of its image where dim is the dimension of vector space and img is the image of map
examples the matrix has rank the first two columns are linearly independent so the rank is at least but since the third is linear combination of the first two the first column minus the second the three columns are linearly dependent so the rank must be less than the matrix has rank there are nonzero columns so the rank is positive but any pair of columns is linearly dependent
similarly the transpose of has rank indeed since the column vectors of are the row vectors of the transpose of the statement that the column rank of matrix equals its row rank is equivalent to the statement that the rank of matrix is equal to the rank of its transpose rank rank at
computing the rank of matrix rank from row echelon forms common approach to finding the rank of matrix is to reduce it to simpler form generally row echelon form by elementary row operations
row operations do not change the row space hence do not change the row rank and being invertible map the column space to an isomorphic space hence do not change the column rank
once in row echelon form the rank is clearly the same for both row rank and column rank and equals the number of pivots or basic columns and also the number of non zero rows
for example the matrix given by can be put in reduced row echelon form by using the following elementary row operations the final matrix in row echelon form has two non zero rows and thus the rank of matrix is
computation when applied to floating point computations on computers basic gaussian elimination lu decomposition can be unreliable and rank revealing decomposition should be used instead
an effective alternative is the singular value decomposition svd but there are other less expensive choices such as qr decomposition with pivoting so called rank revealing qr factorization which are still more numerically robust than gaussian elimination
numerical determination of rank requires criterion for deciding when value such as singular value from the svd should be treated as zero practical choice which depends on both the matrix and the application
proofs that column rank row rank proof using row reduction the fact that the column and row ranks of any matrix are equal forms is fundamental in linear algebra
many proofs have been given
one of the most elementary ones has been sketched in rank from row echelon forms
here is variant of this proof it is straightforward to show that neither the row rank nor the column rank are changed by an elementary row operation
as gaussian elimination proceeds by elementary row operations the reduced row echelon form of matrix has the same row rank and the same column rank as the original matrix
further elementary column operations allow putting the matrix in the form of an identity matrix possibly bordered by rows and columns of zeros
again this changes neither the row rank nor the column rank
it is immediate that both the row and column ranks of this resulting matrix is the number of its nonzero entries
we present two other proofs of this result
the first uses only basic properties of linear combinations of vectors and is valid over any field
the proof is based upon wardlaw
the second uses orthogonality and is valid for matrices over the real numbers it is based upon mackiw
both proofs can be found in the book by banerjee and roy
proof using linear combinations let be an matrix
let the column rank of be and let cr be any basis for the column space of place these as the columns of an matrix every column of can be expressed as linear combination of the columns in this means that there is an matrix such that cr
is the matrix whose ith column is formed from the coefficients giving the ith column of as linear combination of the columns of in other words is the matrix which contains the multiples for the bases of the column space of which is which are then used to form as whole
now each row of is given by linear combination of the rows of therefore the rows of form spanning set of the row space of and by the steinitz exchange lemma the row rank of cannot exceed this proves that the row rank of is less than or equal to the column rank of this result can be applied to any matrix so apply the result to the transpose of since the row rank of the transpose of is the column rank of and the column rank of the transpose of is the row rank of this establishes the reverse inequality and we obtain the equality of the row rank and the column rank of
also see rank factorization
proof using orthogonality let be an matrix with entries in the real numbers whose row rank is therefore the dimension of the row space of is let xr be basis of the row space of we claim that the vectors ax ax axr are linearly independent
to see why consider linear homogeneous relation involving these vectors with scalar coefficients cr where crxr
we make two observations is linear combination of vectors in the row space of which implies that belongs to the row space of and since av the vector is orthogonal to every row vector of and hence is orthogonal to every vector in the row space of the facts and together imply that is orthogonal to itself which proves that or by the definition of but recall that the xi were chosen as basis of the row space of and so are linearly independent
this implies that cr it follows that ax ax axr are linearly independent
now each axi is obviously vector in the column space of so ax ax axr is set of linearly independent vectors in the column space of and hence the dimension of the column space of the column rank of must be at least as big as this proves that row rank of is no larger than the column rank of now apply this result to the transpose of to get the reverse inequality and conclude as in the previous proof
alternative definitions in all the definitions in this section the matrix is taken to be an matrix over an arbitrary field dimension of image given the matrix there is an associated linear mapping defined by the rank of is the dimension of the image of this definition has the advantage that it can be applied to any linear map without need for specific matrix
rank in terms of nullity given the same linear mapping as above the rank is minus the dimension of the kernel of the rank nullity theorem states that this definition is equivalent to the preceding one
column rank dimension of column space the rank of is the maximal number of linearly independent columns of this is the dimension of the column space of the column space being the subspace of fm generated by the columns of which is in fact just the image of the linear map associated to
row rank dimension of row space the rank of is the maximal number of linearly independent rows of this is the dimension of the row space of
decomposition rank the rank of is the smallest integer such that can be factored as where is an matrix and is matrix
in fact for all integers the following are equivalent the column rank of is less than or equal to there exist columns of size such that every column of is linear combination of there exist an matrix and matrix such that when is the rank this is rank factorization of there exist rows of size such that every row of is linear combination of the row rank of is less than or equal to indeed the following equivalences are obvious
for example to prove from take to be the matrix whose columns are from
to prove from take to be the columns of it follows from the equivalence that the row rank is equal to the column rank
as in the case of the dimension of image characterization this can be generalized to definition of the rank of any linear map the rank of linear map is the minimal dimension of an intermediate space such that can be written as the composition of map and map unfortunately this definition does not suggest an efficient manner to compute the rank for which it is better to use one of the alternative definitions
see rank factorization for details
rank in terms of singular values the rank of equals the number of non zero singular values which is the same as the number of non zero diagonal elements in in the singular value decomposition
determinantal rank size of largest non vanishing minor the rank of is the largest order of any non zero minor in
the order of minor is the side length of the square sub matrix of which it is the determinant
like the decomposition rank characterization this does not give an efficient way of computing the rank but it is useful theoretically single non zero minor witnesses lower bound namely its order for the rank of the matrix which can be useful for example to prove that certain operations do not lower the rank of matrix
non vanishing minor submatrix with non zero determinant shows that the rows and columns of that submatrix are linearly independent and thus those rows and columns of the full matrix are linearly independent in the full matrix so the row and column rank are at least as large as the determinantal rank however the converse is less straightforward
the equivalence of determinantal rank and column rank is strengthening of the statement that if the span of vectors has dimension then of those vectors span the space equivalently that one can choose spanning set that is subset of the vectors the equivalence implies that subset of the rows and subset of the columns simultaneously define an invertible submatrix equivalently if the span of vectors has dimension then of these vectors span the space and there is set of coordinates on which they are linearly independent
tensor rank minimum number of simple tensors the rank of is the smallest number such that can be written as sum of rank matrices where matrix is defined to have rank if and only if it can be written as nonzero product of column vector and row vector this notion of rank is called tensor rank it can be generalized in the separable models interpretation of the singular value decomposition
properties we assume that is an matrix and we define the linear map by ax as above
the rank of an matrix is nonnegative integer and cannot be greater than either or that is matrix that has rank min is said to have full rank otherwise the matrix is rank deficient
only zero matrix has rank zero
is injective or one to one if and only if has rank in this case we say that has full column rank
is surjective or onto if and only if has rank in this case we say that has full row rank
if is square matrix then is invertible if and only if has rank that is has full rank
if is any matrix then if is an matrix of rank then if is an matrix of rank then the rank of is equal to if and only if there exists an invertible matrix and an invertible matrix such that where ir denotes the identity matrix
sylvester rank inequality if is an matrix and is then this is special case of the next inequality
the inequality due to frobenius if ab abc and bc are defined then subadditivity when and are of the same dimension
as consequence rank matrix can be written as the sum of rank matrices but not fewer
the rank of matrix plus the nullity of the matrix equals the number of columns of the matrix
this is the rank nullity theorem
if is matrix over the real numbers then the rank of and the rank of its corresponding gram matrix are equal
thus for real matrices this can be shown by proving equality of their null spaces
the null space of the gram matrix is given by vectors for which if this condition is fulfilled we also have if is matrix over the complex numbers and denotes the complex conjugate of and the conjugate transpose of the adjoint of then applications one useful application of calculating the rank of matrix is the computation of the number of solutions of system of linear equations
according to the rouch capelli theorem the system is inconsistent if the rank of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix
if on the other hand the ranks of these two matrices are equal then the system must have at least one solution
the solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables
otherwise the general solution has free parameters where is the difference between the number of variables and the rank
in this case and assuming the system of equations is in the real or complex numbers the system of equations has infinitely many solutions
in control theory the rank of matrix can be used to determine whether linear system is controllable or observable
in the field of communication complexity the rank of the communication matrix of function gives bounds on the amount of communication needed for two parties to compute the function
generalization there are different generalizations of the concept of rank to matrices over arbitrary rings where column rank row rank dimension of column space and dimension of row space of matrix may be different from the others or may not exist
thinking of matrices as tensors the tensor rank generalizes to arbitrary tensors for tensors of order greater than matrices are order tensors rank is very hard to compute unlike for matrices
there is notion of rank for smooth maps between smooth manifolds
it is equal to the linear rank of the derivative
matrices as tensors matrix rank should not be confused with tensor order which is called tensor rank
tensor order is the number of indices required to write tensor and thus matrices all have tensor order more precisely matrices are tensors of type having one row index and one column index also called covariant order and contravariant order see tensor intrinsic definition for details
the tensor rank of matrix can also mean the minimum number of simple tensors necessary to express the matrix as linear combination and that this definition does agree with matrix rank as here discussed

in the field of multivariate statistics kernel principal component analysis kernel pca is an extension of principal component analysis pca using techniques of kernel methods
using kernel the originally linear operations of pca are performed in reproducing kernel hilbert space
background linear pca recall that conventional pca operates on zero centered data that is where is one of the multivariate observations
it operates by diagonalizing the covariance matrix in other words it gives an eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix which can be rewritten as for see also covariance matrix as linear operator introduction of the kernel to pca to understand the utility of kernel pca particularly for clustering observe that while points cannot in general be linearly separated in dimensions they can almost always be linearly separated in dimensions
that is given points if we map them to an dimensional space with where it is easy to construct hyperplane that divides the points into arbitrary clusters
of course this creates linearly independent vectors so there is no covariance on which to perform eigendecomposition explicitly as we would in linear pca
instead in kernel pca non trivial arbitrary function is chosen that is never calculated explicitly allowing the possibility to use very high dimensional if we never have to actually evaluate the data in that space
since we generally try to avoid working in the space which we will call the feature space we can create the by kernel which represents the inner product space see gramian matrix of the otherwise intractable feature space
the dual form that arises in the creation of kernel allows us to mathematically formulate version of pca in which we never actually solve the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix in the space see kernel trick
the elements in each column of represent the dot product of one point of the transformed data with respect to all the transformed points points
some well known kernels are shown in the example below
because we are never working directly in the feature space the kernel formulation of pca is restricted in that it computes not the principal components themselves but the projections of our data onto those components
to evaluate the projection from point in the feature space onto the kth principal component where superscript means the component not powers of we note that denotes dot product which is simply the elements of the kernel it seems all that left is to calculate and normalize the which can be done by solving the eigenvector equation where is the number of data points in the set and and are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of then to normalize the eigenvectors we require that care must be taken regarding the fact that whether or not has zero mean in its original space it is not guaranteed to be centered in the feature space which we never compute explicitly
since centered data is required to perform an effective principal component analysis we centralize to become where denotes by matrix for which each element takes value we use to perform the kernel pca algorithm described above
one caveat of kernel pca should be illustrated here
in linear pca we can use the eigenvalues to rank the eigenvectors based on how much of the variation of the data is captured by each principal component
this is useful for data dimensionality reduction and it could also be applied to kpca
however in practice there are cases that all variations of the data are same
this is typically caused by wrong choice of kernel scale
large datasets in practice large data set leads to large and storing may become problem
one way to deal with this is to perform clustering on the dataset and populate the kernel with the means of those clusters
since even this method may yield relatively large it is common to compute only the top eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the eigenvalues are calculated in this way
example consider three concentric clouds of points shown we wish to use kernel pca to identify these groups
the color of the points does not represent information involved in the algorithm but only shows how the transformation relocates the data points
first consider the kernel applying this to kernel pca yields the next image
now consider gaussian kernel that is this kernel is measure of closeness equal to when the points coincide and equal to at infinity
note in particular that the first principal component is enough to distinguish the three different groups which is impossible using only linear pca because linear pca operates only in the given in this case two dimensional space in which these concentric point clouds are not linearly separable
applications kernel pca has been demonstrated to be useful for novelty detection and image de noising

in computer science and telecommunication hamming codes are family of linear error correcting codes
hamming codes can detect one bit and two bit errors or correct one bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors
by contrast the simple parity code cannot correct errors and can detect only an odd number of bits in error
hamming codes are perfect codes that is they achieve the highest possible rate for codes with their block length and minimum distance of three richard hamming invented hamming codes in as way of automatically correcting errors introduced by punched card readers
in his original paper hamming elaborated his general idea but specifically focused on the hamming code which adds three parity bits to four bits of data in mathematical terms hamming codes are class of binary linear code
for each integer there is code word with block length and message length hence the rate of hamming codes is which is the highest possible for codes with minimum distance of three the minimal number of bit changes needed to go from any code word to any other code word is three and block length the parity check matrix of hamming code is constructed by listing all columns of length that are non zero which means that the dual code of the hamming code is the shortened hadamard code
the parity check matrix has the property that any two columns are pairwise linearly independent
due to the limited redundancy that hamming codes add to the data they can only detect and correct errors when the error rate is low
this is the case in computer memory usually ram where bit errors are extremely rare and hamming codes are widely used and ram with this correction system is ecc ram ecc memory
in this context an extended hamming code having one extra parity bit is often used
extended hamming codes achieve hamming distance of four which allows the decoder to distinguish between when at most one one bit error occurs and when any two bit errors occur
in this sense extended hamming codes are single error correcting and double error detecting abbreviated as secded
history richard hamming the inventor of hamming codes worked at bell labs in the late on the bell model computer an electromechanical relay based machine with cycle times in seconds
input was fed in on punched paper tape seven eighths of an inch wide which had up to six holes per row
during weekdays when errors in the relays were detected the machine would stop and flash lights so that the operators could correct the problem
during after hours periods and on weekends when there were no operators the machine simply moved on to the next job
hamming worked on weekends and grew increasingly frustrated with having to restart his programs from scratch due to detected errors
in taped interview hamming said and so said damn it if the machine can detect an error why can it locate the position of the error and correct it
over the next few years he worked on the problem of error correction developing an increasingly powerful array of algorithms
in he published what is now known as hamming code which remains in use today in applications such as ecc memory
codes predating hamming number of simple error detecting codes were used before hamming codes but none were as effective as hamming codes in the same overhead of space
parity parity adds single bit that indicates whether the number of ones bit positions with values of one in the preceding data was even or odd
if an odd number of bits is changed in transmission the message will change parity and the error can be detected at this point however the bit that changed may have been the parity bit itself
the most common convention is that parity value of one indicates that there is an odd number of ones in the data and parity value of zero indicates that there is an even number of ones
if the number of bits changed is even the check bit will be valid and the error will not be detected
moreover parity does not indicate which bit contained the error even when it can detect it
the data must be discarded entirely and re transmitted from scratch
on noisy transmission medium successful transmission could take long time or may never occur
however while the quality of parity checking is poor since it uses only single bit this method results in the least overhead
two out of five code two out of five code is an encoding scheme which uses five bits consisting of exactly three and two
this provides ten possible combinations enough to represent the digits
this scheme can detect all single bit errors all odd numbered bit errors and some even numbered bit errors for example the flipping of both bits
however it still cannot correct any of these errors
repetition another code in use at the time repeated every data bit multiple times in order to ensure that it was sent correctly
for instance if the data bit to be sent is an repetition code will send if the three bits received are not identical an error occurred during transmission
if the channel is clean enough most of the time only one bit will change in each triple
therefore and each correspond to bit while and correspond to bit with the greater quantity of digits that are the same or indicating what the data bit should be
code with this ability to reconstruct the original message in the presence of errors is known as an error correcting code
this triple repetition code is hamming code with since there are two parity bits and data bit
such codes cannot correctly repair all errors however
in our example if the channel flips two bits and the receiver gets the system will detect the error but conclude that the original bit is which is incorrect
if we increase the size of the bit string to four we can detect all two bit errors but cannot correct them the quantity of parity bits is even at five bits we can both detect and correct all two bit errors but not all three bit errors
moreover increasing the size of the parity bit string is inefficient reducing throughput by three times in our original case and the efficiency drops drastically as we increase the number of times each bit is duplicated in order to detect and correct more errors
description if more error correcting bits are included with message and if those bits can be arranged such that different incorrect bits produce different error results then bad bits could be identified
in seven bit message there are seven possible single bit errors so three error control bits could potentially specify not only that an error occurred but also which bit caused the error
hamming studied the existing coding schemes including two of five and generalized their concepts
to start with he developed nomenclature to describe the system including the number of data bits and error correction bits in block
for instance parity includes single bit for any data word so assuming ascii words with seven bits hamming described this as an code with eight bits in total of which seven are data
the repetition example would be following the same logic
the code rate is the second number divided by the first for our repetition example
hamming also noticed the problems with flipping two or more bits and described this as the distance it is now called the hamming distance after him
parity has distance of so one bit flip can be detected but not corrected and any two bit flips will be invisible
the repetition has distance of as three bits need to be flipped in the same triple to obtain another code word with no visible errors
it can correct one bit errors or it can detect but not correct two bit errors
repetition each bit is repeated four times has distance of so flipping three bits can be detected but not corrected
when three bits flip in the same group there can be situations where attempting to correct will produce the wrong code word
in general code with distance can detect but not correct errors
hamming was interested in two problems at once increasing the distance as much as possible while at the same time increasing the code rate as much as possible
during the he developed several encoding schemes that were dramatic improvements on existing codes
the key to all of his systems was to have the parity bits overlap such that they managed to check each other as well as the data
general algorithm the following general algorithm generates single error correcting sec code for any number of bits
the main idea is to choose the error correcting bits such that the index xor the xor of all the bit positions containing is we use positions etc
in binary as the error correcting bits which guarantees it is possible to set the error correcting bits so that the index xor of the whole message is if the receiver receives string with index xor they can conclude there were no corruptions and otherwise the index xor indicates the index of the corrupted bit
an algorithm can be deduced from the following description number the bits starting from bit etc
write the bit numbers in binary etc
all bit positions that are powers of two have single bit in the binary form of their position are parity bits etc
all other bit positions with two or more bits in the binary form of their position are data bits
each data bit is included in unique set of or more parity bits as determined by the binary form of its bit position
parity bit covers all bit positions which have the least significant bit set bit the parity bit itself etc
parity bit covers all bit positions which have the second least significant bit set bits etc
parity bit covers all bit positions which have the third least significant bit set bits etc
parity bit covers all bit positions which have the fourth least significant bit set bits etc
in general each parity bit covers all bits where the bitwise and of the parity position and the bit position is non zero if byte of data to be encoded is then the data word using to represent the parity bits would be and the code word is the choice of the parity even or odd is irrelevant but the same choice must be used for both encoding and decoding
this general rule can be shown visually shown are only encoded bits parity data but the pattern continues indefinitely
the key thing about hamming codes that can be seen from visual inspection is that any given bit is included in unique set of parity bits
to check for errors check all of the parity bits
the pattern of errors called the error syndrome identifies the bit in error
if all parity bits are correct there is no error
otherwise the sum of the positions of the erroneous parity bits identifies the erroneous bit
for example if the parity bits in positions and indicate an error then bit is in error
if only one parity bit indicates an error the parity bit itself is in error
with parity bits bits from up to can be covered
after discounting the parity bits bits remain for use as data
as varies we get all the possible hamming codes hamming codes with additional parity secded hamming codes have minimum distance of which means that the decoder can detect and correct single error but it cannot distinguish double bit error of some codeword from single bit error of different codeword
thus some double bit errors will be incorrectly decoded as if they were single bit errors and therefore go undetected unless no correction is attempted
to remedy this shortcoming hamming codes can be extended by an extra parity bit
this way it is possible to increase the minimum distance of the hamming code to which allows the decoder to distinguish between single bit errors and two bit errors
thus the decoder can detect and correct single error and at the same time detect but not correct double error
if the decoder does not attempt to correct errors it can reliably detect triple bit errors
if the decoder does correct errors some triple errors will be mistaken for single errors and corrected to the wrong value
error correction is therefore trade off between certainty the ability to reliably detect triple bit errors and resiliency the ability to keep functioning in the face of single bit errors
this extended hamming code is popular in computer memory systems where it is known as secded abbreviated from single error correction double error detection
particularly popular is the code truncated hamming code plus an additional parity bit which has the same space overhead as parity code
hamming code in hamming introduced the hamming code
it encodes four data bits into seven bits by adding three parity bits
it can detect and correct single bit errors
with the addition of an overall parity bit it can also detect but not correct double bit errors
construction of and the matrix is called canonical generator matrix of linear code and is called parity check matrix
this is the construction of and in standard or systematic form
regardless of form and for linear block codes must satisfy an all zeros matrix since
the parity check matrix of hamming code is constructed by listing all columns of length that are pair wise independent
thus is matrix whose left side is all of the nonzero tuples where order of the tuples in the columns of matrix does not matter
the right hand side is just the identity matrix
so can be obtained from by taking the transpose of the left hand side of with the identity identity matrix on the left hand side of the code generator matrix and the parity check matrix are and finally these matrices can be mutated into equivalent non systematic codes by the following operations column permutations swapping columns elementary row operations replacing row with linear combination of rows encoding examplefrom the above matrix we have codewords
let be row vector of binary data bits
the codeword for any of the possible data vectors is given by the standard matrix product where the summing operation is done modulo
using the generator matrix from above we have after applying modulo to the sum hamming code with an additional parity bit the hamming code can easily be extended to an code by adding an extra parity bit on top of the encoded word see hamming
this can be summed up with the revised matrices and note that is not in standard form
to obtain elementary row operations can be used to obtain an equivalent matrix to in systematic form for example the first row in this matrix is the sum of the second and third rows of in non systematic form
using the systematic construction for hamming codes from above the matrix is apparent and the systematic form of is written as the non systematic form of can be row reduced using elementary row operations to match this matrix
the addition of the fourth row effectively computes the sum of all the codeword bits data and parity as the fourth parity bit
for example is encoded using the non systematic form of at the start of this section into where blue digits are data red digits are parity bits from the hamming code and the green digit is the parity bit added by the code
the green digit makes the parity of the codewords even
finally it can be shown that the minimum distance has increased from in the code to in the code
therefore the code can be defined as hamming code
to decode the hamming code first check the parity bit
if the parity bit indicates an error single error correction the hamming code will indicate the error location with no error indicating the parity bit
if the parity bit is correct then single error correction will indicate the bitwise exclusive or of two error locations
if the locations are equal no error then double bit error either has not occurred or has cancelled itself out
otherwise double bit error has occurred

dandy is man who places particular importance upon physical appearance refined language and leisurely hobbies pursued with the appearance of nonchalance
dandy could be self made man who strove to imitate an aristocratic lifestyle despite coming from middle class background especially in late th and early th century britain
previous manifestations of the petit ma tre french for small master and the muscadin have been noted by john prevost but the modern practice of dandyism first appeared in the revolutionary both in london and in paris
the dandy cultivated cynical reserve yet to such extremes that novelist george meredith himself no dandy once defined cynicism as intellectual dandyism
some took more benign view thomas carlyle wrote in sartor resartus that dandy was no more than clothes wearing man
honor de balzac introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved henri de marsay in la fille aux yeux or part of la com die humaine who fulfils at first the model of perfect dandy until an obsessive love pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy
charles baudelaire defined the dandy in the later metaphysical phase of dandyism as one who elevates aesthetics to living religion that the dandy mere existence reproaches the responsible citizen of the middle class dandyism in certain respects comes close to spirituality and to stoicism and these beings have no other status but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons of satisfying their passions of feeling and thinking
dandyism is form of romanticism
contrary to what many thoughtless people seem to believe dandyism is not even an excessive delight in clothes and material elegance
for the perfect dandy these things are no more than the symbol of the aristocratic superiority of mind
the linkage of clothing with political protest had become particularly english characteristic during the th century
given these connotations dandyism can be seen as political protest against the levelling effect of egalitarian principles often including nostalgic adherence to feudal or pre industrial values such as the ideals of the perfect gentleman or the autonomous aristocrat
paradoxically the dandy required an audience as susann schmid observed in examining the successfully marketed lives of oscar wilde and lord byron who exemplify the dandy roles in the public sphere both as writers and as personae providing sources of gossip and scandal
nigel rodgers in the dandy peacock or enigma
questions wilde status as genuine dandy seeing him as someone who only assumed dandified stance in passing not man dedicated to the exacting ideals of dandyism
etymology the origin of the word is uncertain
eccentricity defined as taking characteristics such as dress and appearance to extremes began to be applied generally to human behavior in the
similarly the word dandy first appears in the late th century
in the years immediately preceding the american revolution the first verse and chorus of yankee doodle derided the perceived poverty and rustic manners of american colonists suggesting that whereas fine horse and gold braided clothing mac aroni were required to set dandy apart from those around him the average american colonist means were so meager that ownership of mere pony and few feathers for personal ornamentation would qualify one of them as dandy by comparison to and or in the minds of his even less sophisticated eurasian compatriots
slightly later scottish border ballad circa also features the word but probably without all the contextual aspects of its more recent meaning
the original full form of dandy may have been jack dandy
it was vogue word during the napoleonic wars
in that contemporary slang dandy was differentiated from fop in that the dandy dress was more refined and sober than the fop
in the twenty first century the word dandy is jocular often sarcastic adjective meaning fine or great when used in the form of noun it refers to well groomed and well dressed man but often to one who is also self absorbed
beau brummell and early british dandyism the model dandy in british society was george bryan beau brummell in his early days an undergraduate student at oriel college oxford and later an associate of the prince regent
brummell was not from an aristocratic background indeed his greatness was based on nothing at all as
barbey aurevilly observed in never unpowdered or unperfumed immaculately bathed and shaved and dressed in plain dark blue coat he was always perfectly brushed perfectly fitted showing much perfectly starched linen all freshly laundered and composed with an elaborately knotted cravat
from the mid beau brummell was the early incarnation of the celebrity man chiefly famous for being famous by the time pitt taxed hair powder in to help pay for the war against france and to discourage the use of flour which had recently increased in both rarity and price owing to bad harvests in such frivolous product brummell had already abandoned wearing wig and had his hair cut in the roman fashion la brutus
moreover he led the transition from breeches to snugly tailored dark pantaloons which directly led to modern trousers the sartorial mainstay of men clothes in the western world for the past two centuries
in upon coming of age beau brummell inherited from his father fortune of thirty thousand pounds which he spent mostly on costume gambling and high living
in he suffered bankruptcy the dandy stereotyped fate he fled his creditors to france quietly dying in in lunatic asylum in caen aged men of more notable accomplishments than beau brummell also adopted the dandiacal pose lord byron occasionally dressed the part helping reintroduce the frilled lace cuffed and lace collared poet shirt
in that spirit he had his portrait painted in albanian costume another prominent dandy of the period was alfred guillaume gabriel orsay the count orsay who had been friends with byron and who moved in the highest social circles of london
thomas carlyle in sartor resartus wrote dandy is clothes wearing man man whose trade office and existence consists in the wearing of clothes
every faculty of his soul spirit purse and person is heroically consecrated to this one object the wearing of clothes wisely and well so that as others dress to live he lives to dress and now for all this perennial martyrdom and poesy and even prophecy what is it that the dandy asks in return
solely we may say that you would recognise his existence would admit him to be living object or even failing this visual object or thing that will reflect rays of light by the mid th century the english dandy within the muted palette of male fashion exhibited minute refinements the quality of the fine woollen cloth the slope of pocket flap or coat revers exactly the right colour for the gloves the correct amount of shine on boots and shoes and so on
it was an image of well dressed man who while taking infinite pains about his appearance affected indifference to it
this refined dandyism continued to be regarded as an essential strand of male englishness
dandyism in france the beginnings of dandyism in france were bound to the politics of the french revolution the initial stage of dandyism the gilded youth was political statement of dressing in an aristocratic style to distinguish its members from the sans culottes
during his heyday beau brummell dictat on both fashion and etiquette reigned supreme
his habits of dress and fashion were much imitated especially in france where in curious development they became the rage especially in bohemian quarters
there dandies sometimes were celebrated in revolutionary terms self created men of consciously designed personality radically breaking with past traditions
with elaborate dress and idle decadent styles of life french bohemian dandies sought to convey contempt for and superiority to bourgeois society
in the latter th century this fancy dress bohemianism was major influence on the symbolist movement in french literature baudelaire was deeply interested in dandyism and memorably wrote that dandy aspirant must have no profession other than elegance
no other status but that of cultivating the idea of beauty in their own persons
the dandy must aspire to be sublime without interruption he must live and sleep before mirror
other french intellectuals also were interested in the dandies strolling the streets and boulevards of paris
jules am barbey aurevilly wrote on dandyism and george brummell an essay devoted in great measure to examining the career of beau brummell
later dandyism the literary dandy is familiar figure in the writings and sometimes the self presentation of oscar wilde
munro clovis and reginald
wodehouse bertie wooster and ronald firbank writers linked by their subversive air
the poets algernon charles swinburne and oscar wilde walter pater the american artist james mcneill whistler joris karl huysmans and max beerbohm were dandies of the belle poque as was robert de montesquiou marcel proust inspiration for the baron de charlus
in italy gabriele annunzio and carlo bugatti exemplified the artistic bohemian dandyism of the fin de siecle
wilde wrote that one should either be work of art or wear work of art
at the end of the th century american dandies were called dudes
evander berry wall was nicknamed the king of the dudes
george walden in the essay who dandy identifies no coward andy warhol and quentin crisp as modern dandies
the character psmith in the novels of wodehouse is considered dandy both physically and intellectually
agatha christie poirot is said to be dandy
the artist sebastian horsley described himself as dandy in the underworld in his eponymous autobiography in japan dandyism has become fashion subculture with historical roots dating back to the edo period in spain during the early th century curious phenomenon developed linked to the idea of dandyism
while in england and france individuals from the middle classes adopted aristocratic manners the spanish aristocracy adopted the fashions of the lower classes called majos
they were characterized by their elaborate outfits and sense of style as opposed to the modern frenchified afrancesados as for their cheeky arrogant attitude
some famous dandies in later times were amongst other the duke of osuna mariano tellez gir artist salvador dal and poet lu cernuda
later thought albert camus said in homme volt that the dandy creates his own unity by aesthetic means
but it is an aesthetic of negation
to live and die before mirror that according to baudelaire was the dandy slogan
it is indeed coherent slogan
the dandy is by occupation always in opposition
he can only exist by defiance
the dandy therefore is always compelled to astonish
singularity is his vocation excess his way to perfection
perpetually incomplete always on the fringe of things he compels others to create him while denying their values
he plays at life because he is unable to live it
jean baudrillard said that dandyism is an aesthetic form of nihilism
quaintrelle the female counterpart is quaintrelle woman who emphasizes life of passion expressed through personal style leisurely pastimes charm and cultivation of life pleasures
in the th century cointerrels male and cointrelles female emerged based upon coint word applied to things skillfully made later indicating person of beautiful dress and refined speech
by the th century coint became quaint indicating elegant speech and beauty
middle english dictionaries note quaintrelle as beautifully dressed woman or overly dressed but do not include the favorable personality elements of grace and charm
the notion of quaintrelle sharing the major philosophical components of refinement with dandies is modern development that returns quaintrelles to their historic roots
female dandies did overlap with male dandies for brief period during the early th century when dandy had derisive definition of fop or over the top fellow the female equivalents were dandyess or dandizette
charles dickens in all the year around comments the dandies and dandizettes of must have been strange race
dandizette was term applied to the feminine devotees to dress and their absurdities were fully equal to those of the dandies
in charms of dandyism in three volumes was published by olivia moreland chief of the female dandies most likely one of many pseudonyms used by thomas ashe
olivia moreland may have existed as ashe did write several novels about living persons
throughout the novel dandyism is associated with living in style
later as the word dandy evolved to denote refinement it became applied solely to men
popular culture and performance in the victorian city notes this evolution in the latter th century
or dandizette although the term was increasingly reserved for men
in popular culture jason king the series featured the further adventures of the title character played by peter wyngarde who had first appeared in department
in that series he was dilettante dandy and author of series of adventure novels working as part of team of investigators
in jason king he had left that service to concentrate on writing the adventures of mark caine who closely resembled jason king in looks manner style and personality
none of the other regular characters from department appeared in this series although department itself is occasionally referred to in dialogue

in coding theory parity check matrix of linear block code is matrix which describes the linear relations that the components of codeword must satisfy
it can be used to decide whether particular vector is codeword and is also used in decoding algorithms
definition formally parity check matrix of linear code is generator matrix of the dual code
this means that codeword is in if and only if the matrix vector product hc some authors would write this in an equivalent form ch
the rows of parity check matrix are the coefficients of the parity check equations
that is they show how linear combinations of certain digits components of each codeword equal zero
for example the parity check matrix compactly represents the parity check equations that must be satisfied for the vector to be codeword of from the definition of the parity check matrix it directly follows the minimum distance of the code is the minimum number such that every columns of parity check matrix are linearly independent while there exist columns of that are linearly dependent
creating parity check matrix the parity check matrix for given code can be derived from its generator matrix and vice versa
if the generator matrix for an code is in standard form then the parity check matrix is given by because negation is performed in the finite field fq
note that if the characteristic of the underlying field is in that field as in binary codes then so the negation is unnecessary
for example if binary code has the generator matrix then its parity check matrix is it can be verified that is matrix while is matrix
syndromes for any row vector of the ambient vector space hx is called the syndrome of the vector is codeword if and only if the calculation of syndromes is the basis for the syndrome decoding algorithm

introduction to coding theory
in probability theory and statistics variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of random variable from its population mean or sample mean
variance is measure of dispersion meaning it is measure of how far set of numbers is spread out from their average value
variance has central role in statistics where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics statistical inference hypothesis testing goodness of fit and monte carlo sampling
variance is an important tool in the sciences where statistical analysis of data is common
the variance is the square of the standard deviation the second central moment of distribution and the covariance of the random variable with itself and it is often represented by var or an advantage of variance as measure of dispersion is that it is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than other measures of dispersion such as the expected absolute deviation for example the variance of sum of uncorrelated random variables is equal to the sum of their variances
disadvantage of the variance for practical applications is that unlike the standard deviation its units differ from the random variable which is why the standard deviation is more commonly reported as measure of dispersion once the calculation is finished
there are two distinct concepts that are both called variance
one as discussed above is part of theoretical probability distribution and is defined by an equation
the other variance is characteristic of set of observations
when variance is calculated from observations those observations are typically measured from real world system
if all possible observations of the system are present then the calculated variance is called the population variance
normally however only subset is available and the variance calculated from this is called the sample variance
the variance calculated from sample is considered an estimate of the full population variance
there are multiple ways to calculate an estimate of the population variance as discussed in the section below
the two kinds of variance are closely related
to see how consider that theoretical probability distribution can be used as generator of hypothetical observations
if an infinite number of observations are generated using distribution then the sample variance calculated from that infinite set will match the value calculated using the distribution equation for variance
etymology the term variance was first introduced by ronald fisher in his paper the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance the great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of human measurement from its mean follow very closely the normal law of errors and therefore that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error
when there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations and it is found that the distribution when both causes act together has standard deviation it is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability
we shall term this quantity the variance definition the variance of random variable is the expected value of the squared deviation from the mean of var
this definition encompasses random variables that are generated by processes that are discrete continuous neither or mixed
the variance can also be thought of as the covariance of random variable with itself var cov
the variance is also equivalent to the second cumulant of probability distribution that generates the variance is typically designated as var or sometimes as or or symbolically as or simply pronounced sigma squared
the expression for the variance can be expanded as follows var in other words the variance of is equal to the mean of the square of minus the square of the mean of this equation should not be used for computations using floating point arithmetic because it suffers from catastrophic cancellation if the two components of the equation are similar in magnitude
for other numerically stable alternatives see algorithms for calculating variance
discrete random variable if the generator of random variable is discrete with probability mass function then var where is the expected value
when such discrete weighted variance is specified by weights whose sum is not then one divides by the sum of the weights
the variance of collection of equally likely values can be written as var where is the average value
that is the variance of set of equally likely values can be equivalently expressed without directly referring to the mean in terms of squared deviations of all pairwise squared distances of points from each other var
absolutely continuous random variable if the random variable has probability density function and is the corresponding cumulative distribution function then var or equivalently var where is the expected value of given by
in these formulas the integrals with respect to and are lebesgue and lebesgue stieltjes integrals respectively
if the function is riemann integrable on every finite interval then var where the integral is an improper riemann integral
examples exponential distribution the exponential distribution with parameter is continuous distribution whose probability density function is given by on the interval
its mean can be shown to be using integration by parts and making use of the expected value already calculated we have thus the variance of is given by var
fair die fair six sided die can be modeled as discrete random variable with outcomes through each with equal probability
the expected value of is therefore the variance of is var the general formula for the variance of the outcome of an sided die is var
commonly used probability distributions the following table lists the variance for some commonly used probability distributions
properties basic properties variance is non negative because the squares are positive or zero var the variance of constant is zero
var conversely if the variance of random variable is then it is almost surely constant
that is it always has the same value var
issues of finiteness if distribution does not have finite expected value as is the case for the cauchy distribution then the variance cannot be finite either
however some distributions may not have finite variance despite their expected value being finite
an example is pareto distribution whose index satisfies
decomposition the general formula for variance decomposition or the law of total variance is if and are two random variables and the variance of exists then var var var
the conditional expectation of given and the conditional variance var may be understood as follows
given any particular value of the random variable there is conditional expectation given the event this quantity depends on the particular value it is function
that same function evaluated at the random variable is the conditional expectation
in particular if is discrete random variable assuming possible values with corresponding probabilities then in the formula for total variance the first term on the right hand side becomes var where var
similarly the second term on the right hand side becomes var where and thus the total variance is given by var
similar formula is applied in analysis of variance where the corresponding formula is total between within here refers to the mean of the squares
in linear regression analysis the corresponding formula is total regression residual
this can also be derived from the additivity of variances since the total observed score is the sum of the predicted score and the error score where the latter two are uncorrelated
similar decompositions are possible for the sum of squared deviations sum of squares total between within total regression residual
calculation from the cdf the population variance for non negative random variable can be expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function using this expression can be used to calculate the variance in situations where the cdf but not the density can be conveniently expressed
characteristic property the second moment of random variable attains the minimum value when taken around the first moment mean of the random variable
conversely if continuous function satisfies for all random variables then it is necessarily of the form where this also holds in the multidimensional case
units of measurement unlike the expected absolute deviation the variance of variable has units that are the square of the units of the variable itself
for example variable measured in meters will have variance measured in meters squared
for this reason describing data sets via their standard deviation or root mean square deviation is often preferred over using the variance
in the dice example the standard deviation is slightly larger than the expected absolute deviation of the standard deviation and the expected absolute deviation can both be used as an indicator of the spread of distribution
the standard deviation is more amenable to algebraic manipulation than the expected absolute deviation and together with variance and its generalization covariance is used frequently in theoretical statistics however the expected absolute deviation tends to be more robust as it is less sensitive to outliers arising from measurement anomalies or an unduly heavy tailed distribution
propagation addition and multiplication by constant variance is invariant with respect to changes in location parameter
that is if constant is added to all values of the variable the variance is unchanged var var
if all values are scaled by constant the variance is scaled by the square of that constant var var
the variance of sum of two random variables is given by var var var cov var var var cov where cov is the covariance
linear combinations in general for the sum of random variables the variance becomes var cov var cov see also general bienaym identity
these results lead to the variance of linear combination as var cov var cov var cov
if the random variables are such that cov then they are said to be uncorrelated
it follows immediately from the expression given earlier that if the random variables are uncorrelated then the variance of their sum is equal to the sum of their variances or expressed symbolically var var
since independent random variables are always uncorrelated see covariance uncorrelatedness and independence the equation above holds in particular when the random variables are independent
thus independence is sufficient but not necessary for the variance of the sum to equal the sum of the variances
matrix notation for the variance of linear combination define as column vector of random variables and as column vector of scalars therefore is linear combination of these random variables where denotes the transpose of also let be the covariance matrix of the variance of is then given by var this implies that the variance of the mean can be written as with column vector of ones var var
sum of variables sum of uncorrelated variables one reason for the use of the variance in preference to other measures of dispersion is that the variance of the sum or the difference of uncorrelated random variables is the sum of their variances var var
this statement is called the bienaym formula and was discovered in it is often made with the stronger condition that the variables are independent but being uncorrelated suffices
so if all the variables have the same variance then since division by is linear transformation this formula immediately implies that the variance of their mean is var var var that is the variance of the mean decreases when increases
this formula for the variance of the mean is used in the definition of the standard error of the sample mean which is used in the central limit theorem
to prove the initial statement it suffices to show that var var var
the general result then follows by induction
starting with the definition var using the linearity of the expectation operator and the assumption of independence or uncorrelatedness of and this further simplifies as follows var var var
sum of correlated variables sum of correlated variables with fixed sample size in general the variance of the sum of variables is the sum of their covariances var cov var cov
note the second equality comes from the fact that cov xi xi var xi
here cov is the covariance which is zero for independent random variables if it exists
the formula states that the variance of sum is equal to the sum of all elements in the covariance matrix of the components
the next expression states equivalently that the variance of the sum is the sum of the diagonal of covariance matrix plus two times the sum of its upper triangular elements or its lower triangular elements this emphasizes that the covariance matrix is symmetric
this formula is used in the theory of cronbach alpha in classical test theory
so if the variables have equal variance and the average correlation of distinct variables is then the variance of their mean is var this implies that the variance of the mean increases with the average of the correlations
in other words additional correlated observations are not as effective as additional independent observations at reducing the uncertainty of the mean
moreover if the variables have unit variance for example if they are standardized then this simplifies to var this formula is used in the spearman brown prediction formula of classical test theory
this converges to if goes to infinity provided that the average correlation remains constant or converges too
so for the variance of the mean of standardized variables with equal correlations or converging average correlation we have lim var therefore the variance of the mean of large number of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation
this makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the population mean even though the law of large numbers states that the sample mean will converge for independent variables
sum of uncorrelated variables with random sample size there are cases when sample is taken without knowing in advance how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion
in such cases the sample size is random variable whose variation adds to the variation of such that var var var which follows from the law of total variance
if has poisson distribution then var with estimator so the estimator of var becomes giving se weighted sum of variables the scaling property and the bienaym formula along with the property of the covariance cov ax by ab cov jointly imply that var var var cov
this implies that in weighted sum of variables the variable with the largest weight will have disproportionally large weight in the variance of the total
for example if and are uncorrelated and the weight of is two times the weight of then the weight of the variance of will be four times the weight of the variance of the expression above can be extended to weighted sum of multiple variables var var cov product of variables product of independent variables if two variables and are independent the variance of their product is given by var var var var var
equivalently using the basic properties of expectation it is given by var
product of statistically dependent variables in general if two variables are statistically dependent then the variance of their product is given by var cov cov var var cov arbitrary functions the delta method uses second order taylor expansions to approximate the variance of function of one or more random variables see taylor expansions for the moments of functions of random variables
for example the approximate variance of function of one variable is given by var var provided that is twice differentiable and that the mean and variance of are finite
population variance and sample variance real world observations such as the measurements of yesterday rain throughout the day typically cannot be complete sets of all possible observations that could be made
as such the variance calculated from the finite set will in general not match the variance that would have been calculated from the full population of possible observations
this means that one estimates the mean and variance from limited set of observations by using an estimator equation
the estimator is function of the sample of observations drawn without observational bias from the whole population of potential observations
in this example that sample would be the set of actual measurements of yesterday rainfall from available rain gauges within the geography of interest
the simplest estimators for population mean and population variance are simply the mean and variance of the sample the sample mean and uncorrected sample variance these are consistent estimators they converge to the correct value as the number of samples increases but can be improved
estimating the population variance by taking the sample variance is close to optimal in general but can be improved in two ways
most simply the sample variance is computed as an average of squared deviations about the sample mean by dividing by however using values other than improves the estimator in various ways
four common values for the denominator are and is the simplest population variance of the sample eliminates bias minimizes mean squared error for the normal distribution and mostly eliminates bias in unbiased estimation of standard deviation for the normal distribution
firstly if the true population mean is unknown then the sample variance which uses the sample mean in place of the true mean is biased estimator it underestimates the variance by factor of correcting by this factor dividing by instead of is called bessel correction
the resulting estimator is unbiased and is called the corrected sample variance or unbiased sample variance
for example when the variance of single observation about the sample mean itself is obviously zero regardless of the population variance
if the mean is determined in some other way than from the same samples used to estimate the variance then this bias does not arise and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the independently known mean
secondly the sample variance does not generally minimize mean squared error between sample variance and population variance
correcting for bias often makes this worse one can always choose scale factor that performs better than the corrected sample variance though the optimal scale factor depends on the excess kurtosis of the population see mean squared error variance and introduces bias
this always consists of scaling down the unbiased estimator dividing by number larger than and is simple example of shrinkage estimator one shrinks the unbiased estimator towards zero
for the normal distribution dividing by instead of or minimizes mean squared error
the resulting estimator is biased however and is known as the biased sample variation
population variance in general the population variance of finite population of size with values xi is given by where the population mean is the population variance can also be computed using this is true because the population variance matches the variance of the generating probability distribution
in this sense the concept of population can be extended to continuous random variables with infinite populations
sample variance biased sample variance in many practical situations the true variance of population is not known priori and must be computed somehow
when dealing with extremely large populations it is not possible to count every object in the population so the computation must be performed on sample of the population
sample variance can also be applied to the estimation of the variance of continuous distribution from sample of that distribution
we take sample with replacement of values yn from the population where and estimate the variance on the basis of this sample
directly taking the variance of the sample data gives the average of the squared deviations here denotes the sample mean since the yi are selected randomly both and are random variables
their expected values can be evaluated by averaging over the ensemble of all possible samples of size from the population
for this gives hence gives an estimate of the population variance that is biased by factor of for this reason is referred to as the biased sample variance
unbiased sample variance correcting for this bias yields the unbiased sample variance denoted either estimator may be simply referred to as the sample variance when the version can be determined by context
the same proof is also applicable for samples taken from continuous probability distribution
the use of the term is called bessel correction and it is also used in sample covariance and the sample standard deviation the square root of variance
the square root is concave function and thus introduces negative bias by jensen inequality which depends on the distribution and thus the corrected sample standard deviation using bessel correction is biased
the unbiased estimation of standard deviation is technically involved problem though for the normal distribution using the term yields an almost unbiased estimator
the unbiased sample variance is statistic for the function meaning that it is obtained by averaging sample statistic over element subsets of the population
distribution of the sample variance being function of random variables the sample variance is itself random variable and it is natural to study its distribution
in the case that yi are independent observations from normal distribution cochran theorem shows that follows scaled chi squared distribution see also asymptotic properties as direct consequence it follows that and var var var if the yi are independent and identically distributed but not necessarily normally distributed then var where is the kurtosis of the distribution and is the fourth central moment
if the conditions of the law of large numbers hold for the squared observations is consistent estimator of
one can see indeed that the variance of the estimator tends asymptotically to zero
an asymptotically equivalent formula was given in kenney and keeping rose and smith and weisstein
samuelson inequality samuelson inequality is result that states bounds on the values that individual observations in sample can take given that the sample mean and biased variance have been calculated
values must lie within the limits
relations with the harmonic and arithmetic means it has been shown that for sample of positive real numbers max where ymax is the maximum of the sample is the arithmetic mean is the harmonic mean of the sample and is the biased variance of the sample
this bound has been improved and it is known that variance is bounded by max max max min min min where ymin is the minimum of the sample
tests of equality of variances the test of equality of variances and the chi square tests are adequate when the sample is normally distributed
non normality makes testing for the equality of two or more variances more difficult
several non parametric tests have been proposed these include the barton david ansari freund siegel tukey test the capon test mood test the klotz test and the sukhatme test
the sukhatme test applies to two variances and requires that both medians be known and equal to zero
the mood klotz capon and barton david ansari freund siegel tukey tests also apply to two variances
they allow the median to be unknown but do require that the two medians are equal
the lehmann test is parametric test of two variances
of this test there are several variants known
other tests of the equality of variances include the box test the box anderson test and the moses test
resampling methods which include the bootstrap and the jackknife may be used to test the equality of variances
moment of inertia the variance of probability distribution is analogous to the moment of inertia in classical mechanics of corresponding mass distribution along line with respect to rotation about its center of mass
it is because of this analogy that such things as the variance are called moments of probability distributions
the covariance matrix is related to the moment of inertia tensor for multivariate distributions
the moment of inertia of cloud of points with covariance matrix of is given by tr
this difference between moment of inertia in physics and in statistics is clear for points that are gathered along line
suppose many points are close to the axis and distributed along it
the covariance matrix might look like
that is there is the most variance in the direction
physicists would consider this to have low moment about the axis so the moment of inertia tensor is
semivariance the semivariance is calculated in the same manner as the variance but only those observations that fall below the mean are included in the calculation it is also described as specific measure in different fields of application
for skewed distributions the semivariance can provide additional information that variance does not for inequalities associated with the semivariance see chebyshev inequality semivariances
generalizations for complex variables if is scalar complex valued random variable with values in then its variance is where is the complex conjugate of this variance is real scalar
for vector valued random variables as matrix if is vector valued random variable with values in and thought of as column vector then natural generalization of variance is where and is the transpose of and so is row vector
the result is positive semi definite square matrix commonly referred to as the variance covariance matrix or simply as the covariance matrix
if is vector and complex valued random variable with values in then the covariance matrix is where is the conjugate transpose of this matrix is also positive semi definite and square
as scalar another generalization of variance for vector valued random variables which results in scalar value rather than in matrix is the generalized variance det the determinant of the covariance matrix
the generalized variance can be shown to be related to the multidimensional scatter of points around their mean different generalization is obtained by considering the euclidean distance between the random variable and its mean
this results in tr which is the trace of the covariance matrix

in coding theory parity check matrix of linear block code is matrix which describes the linear relations that the components of codeword must satisfy
it can be used to decide whether particular vector is codeword and is also used in decoding algorithms
definition formally parity check matrix of linear code is generator matrix of the dual code
this means that codeword is in if and only if the matrix vector product hc some authors would write this in an equivalent form ch
the rows of parity check matrix are the coefficients of the parity check equations
that is they show how linear combinations of certain digits components of each codeword equal zero
for example the parity check matrix compactly represents the parity check equations that must be satisfied for the vector to be codeword of from the definition of the parity check matrix it directly follows the minimum distance of the code is the minimum number such that every columns of parity check matrix are linearly independent while there exist columns of that are linearly dependent
creating parity check matrix the parity check matrix for given code can be derived from its generator matrix and vice versa
if the generator matrix for an code is in standard form then the parity check matrix is given by because negation is performed in the finite field fq
note that if the characteristic of the underlying field is in that field as in binary codes then so the negation is unnecessary
for example if binary code has the generator matrix then its parity check matrix is it can be verified that is matrix while is matrix
syndromes for any row vector of the ambient vector space hx is called the syndrome of the vector is codeword if and only if the calculation of syndromes is the basis for the syndrome decoding algorithm

introduction to coding theory
in linear algebra the trace of square matrix denoted tr is defined to be the sum of elements on the main diagonal from the upper left to the lower right of the trace is only defined for square matrix
it can be proved that the trace of matrix is the sum of its complex eigenvalues counted with multiplicities
it can also be proved that tr ab tr ba for any two matrices and this implies that similar matrices have the same trace
as consequence one can define the trace of linear operator mapping finite dimensional vector space into itself since all matrices describing such an operator with respect to basis are similar
the trace is related to the derivative of the determinant see jacobi formula
definition the trace of an square matrix is defined as where aii denotes the entry on the ith row and ith column of the entries of can be real numbers or more generally complex numbers
the trace is not defined for non square matrices
expressions like tr exp where is square matrix occur so often in some fields
multivariate statistical theory that shorthand notation has become common tre is sometimes referred to as the exponential trace function it is used in the golden thompson inequality
example let be matrix with then properties basic properties the trace is linear mapping
that is for all square matrices and and all scalars matrix and its transpose have the same trace this follows immediately from the fact that transposing square matrix does not affect elements along the main diagonal
trace of product the trace of square matrix which is the product of two real matrices can be rewritten as the sum of entry wise products of their elements
as the sum of all elements of their hadamard product
phrased directly if and are two real matrices then if one views any real matrix as vector of length mn an operation called vectorization then the above operation on and coincides with the standard dot product
according to the above expression tr is sum of squares and hence is nonnegative equal to zero if and only if is zero
furthermore as noted in the above formula tr tr
these demonstrate the positive definiteness and symmetry required of an inner product it is common to call tr the frobenius inner product of and this is natural inner product on the vector space of all real matrices of fixed dimensions
the norm derived from this inner product is called the frobenius norm and it satisfies submultiplicative property as can be proven with the cauchy schwarz inequality if and are real positive semi definite matrices of the same size
the frobenius inner product and norm arise frequently in matrix calculus and statistics
the frobenius inner product may be extended to hermitian inner product on the complex vector space of all complex matrices of fixed size by replacing by its complex conjugate
the symmetry of the frobenius inner product may be phrased more directly as follows the matrices in the trace of product can be switched without changing the result
if and are and real or complex matrices respectively then this is notable both for the fact that ab does not usually equal ba and also since the trace of either does not usually equal tr tr
the similarity invariance of the trace meaning that tr tr ap for any square matrix and any invertible matrix of the same dimensions is fundamental consequence
this is proved by similarity invariance is the crucial property of the trace in order to discuss traces of linear transformations as below
additionally for real column vectors and the trace of the outer product is equivalent to the inner product cyclic property more generally the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations that is this is known as the cyclic property
arbitrary permutations are not allowed in general however if products of three symmetric matrices are considered any permutation is allowed since where the first equality is because the traces of matrix and its transpose are equal
note that this is not true in general for more than three factors
trace of kronecker product the trace of the kronecker product of two matrices is the product of their traces characterization of the trace the following three properties characterize the trace up to scalar multiple in the following sense if is linear functional on the space of square matrices that satisfies then and tr are proportional for matrices imposing the normalization makes equal to the trace
trace as the sum of eigenvalues given any real or complex matrix there is where are the eigenvalues of counted with multiplicity
this holds true even if is real matrix and some or all of the eigenvalues are complex numbers
this may be regarded as consequence of the existence of the jordan canonical form together with the similarity invariance of the trace discussed above
trace of commutator when both and are matrices the trace of the ring theoretic commutator of and vanishes tr because tr ab tr ba and tr is linear
one can state this as the trace is map of lie algebras gln from operators to scalars as the commutator of scalars is trivial it is an abelian lie algebra
in particular using similarity invariance it follows that the identity matrix is never similar to the commutator of any pair of matrices
conversely any square matrix with zero trace is linear combinations of the commutators of pairs of matrices
moreover any square matrix with zero trace is unitarily equivalent to square matrix with diagonal consisting of all zeros
traces of special kinds of matrices the trace of the identity matrix is the dimension of the space namely this leads to generalizations of dimension using trace the trace of hermitian matrix is real because the elements on the diagonal are real
the trace of permutation matrix is the number of fixed points of the corresponding permutation because the diagonal term aii is if the ith point is fixed and otherwise
the trace of projection matrix is the dimension of the target space
the matrix px is idempotent more generally the trace of any idempotent matrix
one with equals its own rank
the trace of nilpotent matrix is zero when the characteristic of the base field is zero the converse also holds if tr ak for all then is nilpotent
when the characteristic is positive the identity in dimensions is counterexample as tr tr but the identity is not nilpotent
relationship to eigenvalues if is linear operator represented by square matrix with real or complex entries and if are the eigenvalues of listed according to their algebraic multiplicities then this follows from the fact that is always similar to its jordan form an upper triangular matrix having on the main diagonal
in contrast the determinant of is the product of its eigenvalues that is derivative relationships if is square matrix with small entries and denotes the identity matrix then we have approximately precisely this means that the trace is the derivative of the determinant function at the identity matrix
jacobi formula is more general and describes the differential of the determinant at an arbitrary square matrix in terms of the trace and the adjugate of the matrix
from this or from the connection between the trace and the eigenvalues one can derive relation between the trace function the matrix exponential function and the determinant related characterization of the trace applies to linear vector fields
given matrix define vector field on rn by ax
the components of this vector field are linear functions given by the rows of
its divergence div is constant function whose value is equal to tr
by the divergence theorem one can interpret this in terms of flows if represents the velocity of fluid at location and is region in rn the net flow of the fluid out of is given by tr vol where vol is the volume of the trace is linear operator hence it commutes with the derivative trace of linear operator in general given some linear map where is finite dimensional vector space we can define the trace of this map by considering the trace of matrix representation of that is choosing basis for and describing as matrix relative to this basis and taking the trace of this square matrix
the result will not depend on the basis chosen since different bases will give rise to similar matrices allowing for the possibility of basis independent definition for the trace of linear map
such definition can be given using the canonical isomorphism between the space end of linear maps on and where is the dual space of let be in and let be in
then the trace of the indecomposable element is defined to be the trace of general element is defined by linearity
using an explicit basis for and the corresponding dual basis for one can show that this gives the same definition of the trace as given above
numerical algorithms stochastic estimator the trace can be estimated unbiasedly by hutchinson trick given any matrix and any random with we have
proof expand the expectation directly
usually the random vector is sampled from normal distribution or rademacher distribution
more sophisticated stochastic estimators of trace have been developed
applications if real matrix has zero trace its square is diagonal matrix
the trace of complex matrix is used to classify bius transformations
first the matrix is normalized to make its determinant equal to one
then if the square of the trace is the corresponding transformation is parabolic
if the square is in the interval it is elliptic
finally if the square is greater than the transformation is loxodromic
see classification of bius transformations
the trace is used to define characters of group representations
two representations gl of group are equivalent up to change of basis on if tr tr for all the trace also plays central role in the distribution of quadratic forms
lie algebra the trace is map of lie algebras tr from the lie algebra of linear operators on an dimensional space matrices with entries in to the lie algebra of scalars as is abelian the lie bracket vanishes the fact that this is map of lie algebras is exactly the statement that the trace of bracket vanishes the kernel of this map matrix whose trace is zero is often said to be traceless or trace free and these matrices form the simple lie algebra which is the lie algebra of the special linear group of matrices with determinant the special linear group consists of the matrices which do not change volume while the special linear lie algebra is the matrices which do not alter volume of infinitesimal sets
in fact there is an internal direct sum decomposition of operators matrices into traceless operators matrices and scalars operators matrices
the projection map onto scalar operators can be expressed in terms of the trace concretely as formally one can compose the trace the counit map with the unit map of inclusion of scalars to obtain map mapping onto scalars and multiplying by dividing by makes this projection yielding the formula above
in terms of short exact sequences one has which is analogous to where for lie groups
however the trace splits naturally via times scalars so but the splitting of the determinant would be as the nth root times scalars and this does not in general define function so the determinant does not split and the general linear group does not decompose bilinear forms the bilinear form where are square matrices is called the killing form which is used for the classification of lie algebras
the trace defines bilinear form the form is symmetric non degenerate and associative in the sense that for complex simple lie algebra such as every such bilinear form is proportional to each other in particular to the killing form
two matrices and are said to be trace orthogonal if there is generalization to general representation of lie algebra such that is homomorphism of lie algebras end
the trace form tr on end is defined as above
the bilinear form is symmetric and invariant due to cyclicity
generalizations the concept of trace of matrix is generalized to the trace class of compact operators on hilbert spaces and the analog of the frobenius norm is called the hilbert schmidt norm
if is trace class operator then for any orthonormal basis the trace is given by and is finite and independent of the orthonormal basis the partial trace is another generalization of the trace that is operator valued
the trace of linear operator which lives on product space is equal to the partial traces over and for more properties and generalization of the partial trace see traced monoidal categories
if is general associative algebra over field then trace on is often defined to be any map tr which vanishes on commutators tr for all such trace is not uniquely defined it can always at least be modified by multiplication by nonzero scalar
supertrace is the generalization of trace to the setting of superalgebras
the operation of tensor contraction generalizes the trace to arbitrary tensors
traces in the language of tensor products given vector space there is natural bilinear map given by sending to the scalar
the universal property of the tensor product automatically implies that this bilinear map is induced by linear functional on similarly there is natural bilinear map hom given by sending to the linear map the universal property of the tensor product just as used previously says that this bilinear map is induced by linear map hom
if is finite dimensional then this linear map is linear isomorphism
this fundamental fact is straightforward consequence of the existence of finite basis of and can also be phrased as saying that any linear map can be written as the sum of finitely many rank one linear maps
composing the inverse of the isomorphism with the linear functional obtained above results in linear functional on hom
this linear functional is exactly the same as the trace
using the definition of trace as the sum of diagonal elements the matrix formula tr ab tr ba is straightforward to prove and was given above
in the present perspective one is considering linear maps and and viewing them as sums of rank one maps so that there are linear functionals and and nonzero vectors vi and wj such that vi and wj for any in then for any in the rank one linear map wj vi has trace vi wj and so tr
following the same procedure with and reversed one finds exactly the same formula proving that tr equals tr
the above proof can be regarded as being based upon tensor products given that the fundamental identity of end with is equivalent to the expressibility of any linear map as the sum of rank one linear maps
as such the proof may be written in the notation of tensor products
then one may consider the multilinear map given by sending to further composition with the trace map then results in and this is unchanged if one were to have started with instead
one may also consider the bilinear map end end end given by sending to the composition which is then induced by linear map end end end
it can be seen that this coincides with the linear map
the established symmetry upon composition with the trace map then establishes the equality of the two traces for any finite dimensional vector space there is natural linear map in the language of linear maps it assigns to scalar the linear map idv
sometimes this is called coevaluation map and the trace is called evaluation map
these structures can be axiomatized to define categorical traces in the abstract setting of category theory

in the mathematical discipline of linear algebra matrix decomposition or matrix factorization is factorization of matrix into product of matrices
there are many different matrix decompositions each finds use among particular class of problems
example in numerical analysis different decompositions are used to implement efficient matrix algorithms
for instance when solving system of linear equations the matrix can be decomposed via the lu decomposition
the lu decomposition factorizes matrix into lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix the systems and require fewer additions and multiplications to solve compared with the original system though one might require significantly more digits in inexact arithmetic such as floating point
similarly the qr decomposition expresses as qr with an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix
the system rx is solved by rx qtb and the system rx is solved by back substitution
the number of additions and multiplications required is about twice that of using the lu solver but no more digits are required in inexact arithmetic because the qr decomposition is numerically stable
decompositions related to solving systems of linear equations lu decomposition traditionally applicable to square matrix although rectangular matrices can be applicable
decomposition where is lower triangular and is upper triangular related the ldu decomposition is where is lower triangular with ones on the diagonal is upper triangular with ones on the diagonal and is diagonal matrix
related the lup decomposition is where is lower triangular is upper triangular and is permutation matrix
existence an lup decomposition exists for any square matrix when is an identity matrix the lup decomposition reduces to the lu decomposition
comments the lup and lu decompositions are useful in solving an by system of linear equations these decompositions summarize the process of gaussian elimination in matrix form
matrix represents any row interchanges carried out in the process of gaussian elimination
if gaussian elimination produces the row echelon form without requiring any row interchanges then so an lu decomposition exists
lu reduction block lu decomposition rank factorization applicable to by matrix of rank decomposition where is an by full column rank matrix and is an by full row rank matrix comment the rank factorization can be used to compute the moore penrose pseudoinverse of which one can apply to obtain all solutions of the linear system
cholesky decomposition applicable to square hermitian positive definite matrix decomposition where is upper triangular with real positive diagonal entries comment if the matrix is hermitian and positive semi definite then it has decomposition of the form if the diagonal entries of are allowed to be zero uniqueness for positive definite matrices cholesky decomposition is unique
however it is not unique in the positive semi definite case
comment if is real and symmetric has all real elements comment an alternative is the ldl decomposition which can avoid extracting square roots
qr decomposition applicable to by matrix with linearly independent columns decomposition where is unitary matrix of size by and is an upper triangular matrix of size by uniqueness in general it is not unique but if is of full rank then there exists single that has all positive diagonal elements
if is square also is unique
comment the qr decomposition provides an effective way to solve the system of equations the fact that is orthogonal means that so that is equivalent to which is very easy to solve since is triangular
rrqr factorization interpolative decomposition decompositions based on eigenvalues and related concepts eigendecomposition also called spectral decomposition
applicable to square matrix with linearly independent eigenvectors not necessarily distinct eigenvalues
decomposition where is diagonal matrix formed from the eigenvalues of and the columns of are the corresponding eigenvectors of existence an by matrix always has complex eigenvalues which can be ordered in more than one way to form an by diagonal matrix and corresponding matrix of nonzero columns that satisfies the eigenvalue equation is invertible if and only if the eigenvectors are linearly independent each eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity equal to its algebraic multiplicity
sufficient but not necessary condition for this to happen is that all the eigenvalues are different in this case geometric and algebraic multiplicity are equal to comment one can always normalize the eigenvectors to have length one see the definition of the eigenvalue equation comment every normal matrix matrix for which where is conjugate transpose can be eigendecomposed
for normal matrix and only for normal matrix the eigenvectors can also be made orthonormal and the eigendecomposition reads as
in particular all unitary hermitian or skew hermitian in the real valued case all orthogonal symmetric or skew symmetric respectively matrices are normal and therefore possess this property
comment for any real symmetric matrix the eigendecomposition always exists and can be written as where both and are real valued
comment the eigendecomposition is useful for understanding the solution of system of linear ordinary differential equations or linear difference equations
for example the difference equation starting from the initial condition is solved by which is equivalent to where and are the matrices formed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of since is diagonal raising it to power just involves raising each element on the diagonal to the power this is much easier to do and understand than raising to power since is usually not diagonal
jordan decomposition the jordan normal form and the jordan chevalley decomposition applicable to square matrix comment the jordan normal form generalizes the eigendecomposition to cases where there are repeated eigenvalues and cannot be diagonalized the jordan chevalley decomposition does this without choosing basis
schur decomposition applicable to square matrix decomposition complex version where is unitary matrix is the conjugate transpose of and is an upper triangular matrix called the complex schur form which has the eigenvalues of along its diagonal
comment if is normal matrix then is diagonal and the schur decomposition coincides with the spectral decomposition
real schur decomposition applicable to square matrix decomposition this is version of schur decomposition where and only contain real numbers
one can always write where is real orthogonal matrix is the transpose of and is block upper triangular matrix called the real schur form
the blocks on the diagonal of are of size in which case they represent real eigenvalues or in which case they are derived from complex conjugate eigenvalue pairs
qz decomposition also called generalized schur decomposition applicable to square matrices and comment there are two versions of this decomposition complex and real
decomposition complex version and where and are unitary matrices the superscript represents conjugate transpose and and are upper triangular matrices
comment in the complex qz decomposition the ratios of the diagonal elements of to the corresponding diagonal elements of are the generalized eigenvalues that solve the generalized eigenvalue problem where is an unknown scalar and is an unknown nonzero vector
decomposition real version and where and are matrices containing real numbers only
in this case and are orthogonal matrices the superscript represents transposition and and are block upper triangular matrices
the blocks on the diagonal of and are of size or
takagi factorization applicable to square complex symmetric matrix decomposition where is real nonnegative diagonal matrix and is unitary
denotes the matrix transpose of comment the diagonal elements of are the nonnegative square roots of the eigenvalues of
comment may be complex even if is real
comment this is not special case of the eigendecomposition see above which uses instead of moreover if is not real it is not hermitian and the form using also does not apply
singular value decomposition applicable to by matrix decomposition where is nonnegative diagonal matrix and and satisfy here is the conjugate transpose of or simply the transpose if contains real numbers only and denotes the identity matrix of some dimension
comment the diagonal elements of are called the singular values of comment like the eigendecomposition above the singular value decomposition involves finding basis directions along which matrix multiplication is equivalent to scalar multiplication but it has greater generality since the matrix under consideration need not be square
uniqueness the singular values of are always uniquely determined
and need not to be unique in general
scale invariant decompositions refers to variants of existing matrix decompositions such as the svd that are invariant with respect to diagonal scaling
applicable to by matrix unit scale invariant singular value decomposition where is unique nonnegative diagonal matrix of scale invariant singular values and are unitary matrices is the conjugate transpose of and positive diagonal matrices and comment is analogous to the svd except that the diagonal elements of are invariant with respect to left and or right multiplication of by arbitrary nonsingular diagonal matrices as opposed to the standard svd for which the singular values are invariant with respect to left and or right multiplication of by arbitrary unitary matrices
comment is an alternative to the standard svd when invariance is required with respect to diagonal rather than unitary transformations of uniqueness the scale invariant singular values of given by the diagonal elements of are always uniquely determined
diagonal matrices and and unitary and are not necessarily unique in general
comment and matrices are not the same as those from the svd analogous scale invariant decompositions can be derived from other matrix decompositions to obtain scale invariant eigenvalues
other decompositions polar decomposition applicable to any square complex matrix decomposition right polar decomposition or left polar decomposition where is unitary matrix and and are positive semidefinite hermitian matrices
uniqueness is always unique and equal to which is always hermitian and positive semidefinite
if is invertible then is unique
comment since any hermitian matrix admits spectral decomposition with unitary matrix can be written as
since is positive semidefinite all elements in are non negative
since the product of two unitary matrices is unitary taking one can write which is the singular value decomposition
hence the existence of the polar decomposition is equivalent to the existence of the singular value decomposition
algebraic polar decomposition applicable to square complex non singular matrix decomposition where is complex orthogonal matrix and is complex symmetric matrix
uniqueness if has no negative real eigenvalues then the decomposition is unique
comment the existence of this decomposition is equivalent to being similar to comment variant of this decomposition is where is real matrix and is circular matrix
mostow decomposition applicable to square complex non singular matrix decomposition where is unitary is real anti symmetric and is real symmetric
comment the matrix can also be decomposed as where is unitary is real anti symmetric and is real symmetric
sinkhorn normal form applicable to square real matrix with strictly positive elements
decomposition where is doubly stochastic and and are real diagonal matrices with strictly positive elements
sectoral decomposition applicable to square complex matrix with numerical range contained in the sector
decomposition where is an invertible complex matrix and diag with all
williamson normal form applicable to square positive definite real matrix with order
decomposition diag where sp is symplectic matrix and is nonnegative by diagonal matrix
matrix square root decomposition not unique in general
in the case of positive semidefinite there is unique positive semidefinite such that
generalizations there exist analogues of the svd qr lu and cholesky factorizations for quasimatrices and cmatrices or continuous matrices
quasimatrix is like matrix rectangular scheme whose elements are indexed but one discrete index is replaced by continuous index
likewise cmatrix is continuous in both indices
as an example of cmatrix one can think of the kernel of an integral operator
these factorizations are based on early work by fredholm hilbert and schmidt

in quantum chemistry electron valence state perturbation theory nevpt is perturbative treatment applicable to multireference casci type wavefunctions
it can be considered as generalization of the well known second order ller plesset perturbation theory to multireference complete active space cases
the theory is directly integrated into many quantum chemistry packages such as molcas molpro dalton pyscf and orca
the research performed into the development of this theory led to various implementations
the theory here presented refers to the deployment for the single state nevpt where the perturbative correction is applied to single electronic state
research implementations has been also developed for quasi degenerate cases where set of electronic states undergo the perturbative correction at the same time allowing interaction among themselves
the theory development makes use of the quasi degenerate formalism by lindgren and the hamiltonian multipartitioning technique from zaitsevskii and malrieu
theory let be zero order casci wavefunction defined as linear combination of slater determinants obtained diagonalizing the true hamiltonian inside the casci space where is the projector inside the casci space
it is possible to define perturber wavefunctions in nevpt as zero order wavefunctions of the outer space external to cas where electrons are removed from the inactive part core and virtual orbitals and added to the valence part active orbitals
at second order of perturbation decomposing the zero order casci wavefunction as an antisymmetrized product of the inactive part and valence part then the perturber wavefunctions can be written as the pattern of inactive orbitals involved in the procedure can be grouped as collective index so to represent the various perturber wavefunctions as with an enumerator index for the different wavefunctions
the number of these functions is relative to the degree of contraction of the resulting perturbative space
supposing indexes and referring to core orbitals and referring to active orbitals and and referring to virtual orbitals the possible excitation schemes are two electrons from core orbitals to virtual orbitals the active space is not enriched nor depleted of electrons therefore one electron from core orbital to virtual orbital and one electron from core orbital to an active orbital the active space is enriched with one electron therefore one electron from core orbital to virtual orbital and one electron from an active orbital to virtual orbital the active space is depleted with one electron therefore two electrons from core orbitals to active orbitals active space enriched with two electrons two electrons from active orbitals to virtual orbitals active space depleted with two electrons these cases always represent situations where interclass electronic excitations happen
other three excitation schemes involve single interclass excitation plus an intraclass excitation internal to the active space one electron from core orbital to virtual orbital and an internal active active excitation one electron from core orbital to an active orbital and an internal active active excitation one electron from an active orbital to virtual orbital and an internal active active excitation totally uncontracted approach possible approach is to define the perturber wavefunctions into hilbert spaces defined by those determinants with given and labels
the determinants characterizing these spaces can be written as partition comprising the same inactive core virtual part and all possible valence active parts the full dimensionality of these spaces can be exploited to obtain the definition of the perturbers by diagonalizing the hamiltonian inside them this procedure is impractical given its high computational cost for each space diagonalization of the true hamiltonian must be performed
computationally is preferable to improve the theoretical development making use of the modified dyall hamiltonian this hamiltonian behaves like the true hamiltonian inside the cas space having the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the true hamiltonian projected onto the cas space
also given the decomposition for the wavefunction defined before the action of the dyall hamiltonian can be partitioned into stripping out the constant contribution of the inactive part and leaving subsystem to be solved for the valence part the total energy is the sum of and the energies of the orbitals involved in the definition of the inactive part this introduces the possibility to perform single diagonalization of the valence dyall hamiltonian on the casci zero order wavefunction and evaluate the perturber energies using the property depicted above
strongly contracted approach different choice in the development of the nevpt approach is to choose single function for each space leading to the strongly contracted sc scheme
set of perturbative operators are used to produce single function for each space defined as the projection inside each space of the application of the hamiltonian to the contracted zero order wavefunction
in other words where is the projector onto the subspace
this can be equivalently written as the application of specific part of the hamiltonian to the zero order wavefunction for each space appropriate operators can be devised
we will not present their definition as it could result overkilling
suffice to say that the resulting perturbers are not normalized and their norm plays an important role in the strongly contracted development
to evaluate these norms the spinless density matrix of rank not higher than three between the functions are needed
an important property of the is that any other function of the space which is orthogonal to do not interact with the zero order wavefunction through the true hamiltonian
it is possible to use the functions as basis set for the expansion of the first order correction to the wavefunction and also for the expression of the zero order hamiltonian by means of spectral decomposition where are the normalized
the expression for the first order correction to the wavefunction is therefore and for the energy is this result still misses definition of the perturber energies which can be defined in computationally advantageous approach by means of the dyall hamiltonian leading to developing the first term and extracting the inactive part of the dyall hamiltonian it can be obtained with equal to the sum of the orbital energies of the newly occupied virtual orbitals minus the orbital energies of the unoccupied core orbitals
the term that still needs to be evaluated is the bracket involving the commutator
this can be obtained developing each operator and substituting
to obtain the final result it is necessary to evaluate koopmans matrices and density matrices involving only active indexes
an interesting case is represented by the contribution for the case which is trivial and can be demonstrated identical to the ller plesset second order contribution nevpt can therefore be seen as generalized form of mp to multireference wavefunctions
partially contracted approach an alternative approach named partially contracted pc is to define the perturber wavefunctions in subspace of with dimensionality higher than one like in case of the strongly contracted approach
to define this subspace set of functions is generated by means of the operators after decontraction of their formulation
for example in the case of the operator the partially contracted approach makes use of functions and
these functions must be orthonormalized and purged of linear dependencies which may arise
the resulting set spans the space
once all the spaces have been defined we can obtain as usual set of perturbers from the diagonalization of the hamiltonian true or dyall inside this space as usual the evaluation of the partially contracted perturbative correction by means of the dyall hamiltonian involves simply manageable entities for nowadays computers
although the strongly contracted approach makes use of perturbative space with very low flexibility in general it provides values in very good agreement with those obtained by the more decontracted space defined for the partially contracted approach
this can be probably explained by the fact that the strongly contracted perturbers are good average of the totally decontracted perturbative space
the partially contracted evaluation has very little overhead in computational cost with respect to the strongly contracted one therefore they are normally evaluated together
properties nevpt is blessed with many important properties making the approach very solid and reliable
these properties arise both from the theoretical approach used and on the dyall hamiltonian particular structure size consistency nevpt is size consistent strict separable
briefly if and are two non interacting systems the energy of the supersystem is equal to the sum of the energy of plus the energy of taken by themselves
this property is of particular importance to obtain correctly behaving dissociation curves
absence of intruder states in perturbation theory divergencies can occur if the energy of some perturber happens to be nearly equal to the energy of the zero order wavefunction
this situation which is due to the presence of an energy difference at the denominator can be avoided if the energies associated to the perturbers are guaranteed to be never nearly equal to the zero order energy
nevpt satisfies this requirement
invariance under active orbital rotation the nevpt results are stable if an intraclass active active orbital mixing occurs
this arises both from the structure of the dyall hamiltonian and the properties of casscf wavefunction
this property has been also extended to the intraclass core core and virtual virtual mixing thanks to the non canonical nevpt approach allowing to apply nevpt evaluation without performing an orbital canonization which is required as we saw previously spin purity is guaranteed the resulting wave functions are guaranteed to be spin pure due to the spin free formalism
efficiency although not formal theoretical property computational efficiency is highly important for the evaluation on medium size molecular systems
the current limit of the nevpt application is largely dependent on the feasibility of the previous casscf evaluation which scales factorially with respect to the active space size
the nevpt implementation using the dyall hamiltonian involves the evaluation of koopmans matrices and density matrices up to the four particle density matrix spanning only active orbitals
this is particularly convenient given the small size of currently used active spaces
partitioning into additive classes the perturbative correction to the energy is additive on eight different contributions
although the evaluation of each contribution has different computational cost this fact can be used to improve performance by parallelizing each contribution to different processor

working time is the period of time that person spends at paid labor
unpaid labor such as personal housework or caring for children or pets is not considered part of the working week
many countries regulate the work week by law such as stipulating minimum daily rest periods annual holidays and maximum number of working hours per week
working time may vary from person to person often depending on economic conditions location culture lifestyle choice and the profitability of the individual livelihood
for example someone who is supporting children and paying large mortgage might need to work more hours to meet basic costs of living than someone of the same earning power with lower housing costs
in developed countries like the united kingdom some workers are part time because they are unable to find full time work but many choose reduced work hours to care for children or other family some choose it simply to increase leisure time standard working hours or normal working hours refers to the legislation to limit the working hours per day per week per month or per year
the employer pays higher rates for overtime hours as required in the law
standard working hours of countries worldwide are around to hours per week but not everywhere from hours per week in france to up to hours per week in north korean labor camps and the additional overtime payments are around to above the normal hourly payments
maximum working hours refers to the maximum working hours of an employee
the employee cannot work more than the level specified in the maximum working hours law the world health organization and the international labour organization estimated that globally in one in ten workers were exposed to working or more hours per week and persons died as result of having heart disease event or stroke attributable to having worked these long hours making exposure to long working hours the occupational risk factor with the largest disease burden
hunter gatherer since the the consensus among anthropologists historians and sociologists has been that early hunter gatherer societies enjoyed more leisure time than is permitted by capitalist and agrarian societies for instance one camp of kung bushmen was estimated to work two and half days per week at around hours day
aggregated comparisons show that on average the working day was less than five hours subsequent studies in the examined the machiguenga of the upper amazon and the kayapo of northern brazil
these studies expanded the definition of work beyond purely hunting gathering activities but the overall average across the hunter gatherer societies he studied was still below hours while the maximum was below hours
popular perception is still aligned with the old academic consensus that hunter gatherers worked far in excess of modern humans forty hour week
history the industrial revolution made it possible for larger segment of the population to work year round because this labor was not tied to the season and artificial lighting made it possible to work longer each day
peasants and farm laborers moved from rural areas to work in urban factories and working time during the year increased significantly
before collective bargaining and worker protection laws there was financial incentive for company to maximize the return on expensive machinery by having long hours
records indicate that work schedules as long as twelve to sixteen hours per day six to seven days per week were practiced in some industrial sites
over the th century work hours shortened by almost half partly due to rising wages brought about by renewed economic growth and competition for skilled workers with supporting role from trade unions collective bargaining and progressive legislation
the workweek in most of the industrialized world dropped steadily to about hours after world war ii
the limitation of working hours is also proclaimed by the universal declaration of human rights international covenant on economic social and cultural rights and european social charter
the decline continued at faster pace in europe for example france adopted hour workweek in in china adopted hour week eliminating half day work on saturdays though this is not widely practiced
working hours in industrializing economies like south korea though still much higher than the leading industrial countries are also declining steadily
technology has also continued to improve worker productivity permitting standards of living to rise as hours decline
in developed economies as the time needed to manufacture goods has declined more working hours have become available to provide services resulting in shift of much of the workforce between sectors
economic growth in monetary terms tends to be concentrated in health care education government criminal justice corrections and other activities rather than those that contribute directly to the production of material goods in the mid the netherlands was the first country in the industrialized world where the overall average working week dropped to less than hours
gradual decrease most countries in the developed world have seen average hours worked decrease significantly
for example in the in the late th century it was estimated that the average work week was over hours per week
today the average hours worked in the is around with the average man employed full time for hours per work day and the average woman employed full time for hours per work day
the front runners for lowest average weekly work hours are the netherlands with hours and france with hours
in report of oecd countries germany had the lowest average working hours per week at hours the new economics foundation has recommended moving to hour standard work week to address problems with unemployment high carbon emissions low well being entrenched inequalities overworking family care and the general lack of free time
actual work week lengths have been falling in the developed world factors that have contributed to lowering average work hours and increasing standard of living have been technological advances in efficiency such as mechanization robotics and information technology
the increase of women equally participating in making income as opposed to previously being commonly bound to homemaking and childrearing exclusively
dropping fertility rates leading to fewer hours needed to be worked to support children recent articles supporting four day week have argued that reduced work hours would increase consumption and invigorate the economy
however other articles state that consumption would decrease which could reduce the environmental impact
other arguments for the four day week include improvements to workers level of education due to having extra time to take classes and courses and improvements to workers health less work related stress and extra time for exercise
reduced hours also save money on day care costs and transportation which in turn helps the environment with less carbon related emissions
these benefits increase workforce productivity on per hour basis
workweek structure the structure of the work week varies considerably for different professions and cultures
among salaried workers in the western world the work week often consists of monday to friday or saturday with the weekend set aside as time of personal work and leisure
sunday is set aside in the western world because it is the christian sabbath
the traditional american business hours are to monday to friday representing workweek of five eight hour days comprising hours in total
these are the origin of the phrase to used to describe conventional and possibly tedious job
negatively used it connotes tedious or unremarkable occupation
the phrase also indicates that person is an employee usually in large company rather than an entrepreneur or self employed
more neutrally it connotes job with stable hours and low career risk but still position of subordinate employment
the actual time at work often varies between and hours in practice due to the inclusion or lack of inclusion of breaks
in many traditional white collar positions employees were required to be in the office during these hours to take orders from the bosses hence the relationship between this phrase and subordination
workplace hours have become more flexible but the phrase is still commonly used even in situations where the term does not apply literally
average annual hours per worker oecd ranking trends over time by region europe in most european union countries working time is gradually decreasing
the european union working time directive imposes hour maximum working week that applies to every member state except malta which have an opt out meaning that employees in malta may work longer than hours if they wish but they cannot be forced to do so
major reason for the lower annual hours worked in europe is relatively high amount of paid annual leave
fixed employment comes with four to six weeks of holiday as standard
france france experimented in with sharp cut of legal or statutory working time of the employees in the private and public sector from hours week to hours week with the stated goal to fight against rampant unemployment at that time
the law on working time reduction is also referred to as the aubry law according to the name of the labor minister at that time
employees may and do work more than hours week yet in this case firms must pay them overtime bonuses
if the bonus is determined through collective negotiations it cannot be lower than
if no agreement on working time is signed the legal bonus must be of for the first hours then goes up to for the rest
including overtime the maximum working time cannot exceed hours per week and should not exceed hours per week over weeks in row
in france the labor law also regulates the minimum working hours part time jobs should not allow for less than hours per week without branch collective agreement
these agreements can allow for less under tight conditions
according to the official statistics dares after the introduction of the law on working time reduction actual hours per week performed by full time employed fell from hours in to trough of hours in then gradually went back to hours in in working hours were of
south korea south korea has the fastest shortening working time in the oecd which is the result of the government proactive move to lower working hours at all levels and to increase leisure and relaxation time which introduced the mandatory forty hour five day working week in for companies with over employees
beyond regular working hours it is legal to demand up to hours of overtime during the week plus another hours on weekends
the hour workweek expanded to companies with employees or more in employees or more in or more in or more in and full inclusion to all workers nationwide in july the government has continuously increased public holidays to days in more than the days of the united states and double that of the united kingdom days
despite those efforts south korea work hours are still relatively long with an average hours per year in
japan work hours in japan are decreasing but many japanese still work long hours
recently japan ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw issued draft report recommending major changes to the regulations that govern working hours
the centerpiece of the proposal is an exemption from overtime pay for white collar workers
japan has enacted an hour work day and hour work week hours in specified workplaces
the overtime limits are hours week hours over two weeks hours over four weeks hours month hours over two months and hours over three months however some workers get around these restrictions by working several hours day without clocking in whether physically or metaphorically
the overtime allowance should not be lower than and not more than of the normal hourly rate
workaholism in japan is considered serious social problem leading to early death phenomenon dubbed kar shi meaning death from overwork
mexico mexican laws mandate maximum of hours of work per week but they are rarely observed or enforced due to loopholes in the law the volatility of labor rights in mexico and its underdevelopment relative to other members countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd
indeed private sector employees often work overtime without receiving overtime compensation
fear of unemployment and threats by employers explain in part why the hour work week is disregarded
colombia articles to of the substantive work code in colombia provide for maximum of hours of work week
also the law notes that workdays should be divided into sections to allow break usually given as the meal time which is not counted as work
typically there is hours break for lunch that starts from through in june the colombian congress approved bill for the reduction of the work week from to hours which will be implemented in several stages from to
spain the main labor law in spain the workers statute act limits the amount of working time that an employee is obliged to perform
in the article of this law maximum of hours per day and hours per week are established employees typically receive either or payments per year with approximately days of vacation
according to spanish law spain holds what is known as the convenios colectivos which stipulates that different regulations and laws regarding employee work week and wage apply based on the type of job
overall they rank as the th highest in regard to international gdp growth according to study of the oecd better life index of spanish workers work more than hours per week compared to an average of of workers in oecd countries working hours are regulated by law
mandatory logging of employee working time has been in place since in an attempt by legislators to eliminate unpaid overtime and push for more transparency of actual working hours
non regulated pauses during the workday for coffee or smoking are not permitted to be documented as working time according to ruling by the spanish national court in february
traditional mid day break however one of the interesting aspects of the spanish work day and labor is the traditional presence of break around lunchtime
it is sometimes mistakenly thought to be due to siesta but in fact was due to workers returning to their families for the main midday meal
that break typically of or hours has been kept in the working culture because in the post civil war period most workers had two jobs to be able to sustain their families
following this tradition in small and medium sized cities restaurants and businesses shut down during this time period of for retail and for restaurants
many office jobs only allow one hour or even half hour breaks to eat the meal in office building restaurants or designated lunch rooms
majority of adults emphasize the lack of siesta during the typical work week
only one in ten spaniards take mid day nap percentage less than other european nations
australia in australia between and no marked change took place in the average amount of time spent at work by australians of prime working age that is between and years of age
throughout this period the average time spent at work by prime working age australians including those who did not spend any time at work remained stable at between and hours per week
this unchanging average however masks significant redistribution of work from men to women
between and the average time spent at work by prime working age australian men fell from to hours per week while the average time spent at work by prime working age australian women rose from to hours per week
in the period leading up to the amount of time australian workers spent at work outside the hours of to on weekdays also increased in rapid increase in the number of working hours was reported in study by the australia institute
the study found the average australian worked hours per year at work
according to clive hamilton of the australia institute this surpasses even japan
the australia institute believes that australians work the highest number of hours in the developed world the hour working week was introduced in the vast majority of full time employees in australia work additional overtime hours
survey found that of australia million full time workers million put in more than hours week including million who worked more than hours week and who put in more than hours
united states in the average man employed full time worked hours per work day and the average woman employed full time worked hours per work day
there is no mandatory minimum amount of paid time off for sickness or holiday but the majority of full time civilian workers have access to paid vacation time
by the united states government had inaugurated the hour work week for all federal employees
beginning in under the truman administration the united states became the first known industrialized nation to explicitly albeit secretly and permanently forswear reduction of working time
given the military industrial requirements of the cold war the authors of the then secret national security council report nsc proposed the us government undertake massive permanent national economic expansion that would let it siphon off part of the economic activity produced to support an ongoing military buildup to contain the soviet union
in his annual message to the congress president truman stated in terms of manpower our present defense targets will require an increase of nearly one million men and women in the armed forces within few months and probably not less than four million more in defense production by the end of the year
this means that an additional percent of our labor force and possibly much more will be required by direct defense needs by the end of the year
these manpower needs will call both for increasing our labor force by reducing unemployment and drawing in women and older workers and for lengthening hours of work in essential industries
according to the bureau of labor statistics the average non farm private sector employee worked hours per week as of june as president truman message had predicted the share of working women rose from percent of the labor force in to percent by growing at particularly rapid rate during the
according to bureau of labor statistics report issued may in the overall participation rate of women was percent
the rate rose to percent in percent in percent in and percent in and reached percent by the overall labor force participation rate of women is projected to attain its highest level in at percent
the inclusion of women in the work force can be seen as symbolic of social progress as well as of increasing american productivity and hours worked
between and official price inflation was measured to percent
president truman in his message to congress predicted correctly that his military buildup will cause intense and mounting inflationary pressures
using the data provided by the united states bureau of labor statistics erik rauch has estimated productivity to have increased by nearly
according to rauch if productivity means anything at all worker should be able to earn the same standard of living as worker in only hours per week
in the united states the working time for upper income professionals has increased compared to while total annual working time for low skill low income workers has decreased
this effect is sometimes called the leisure gap
the average working time of married couples of both spouses taken together rose from hours in to hours in
overtime rules many professional workers put in longer hours than the forty hour standard
in professional industries like investment banking and large law firms forty hour workweek is considered inadequate and may result in job loss or failure to be promoted
medical residents in the united states routinely work long hours as part of their training
workweek policies are not uniform in the many compensation arrangements are legal and three of the most common are wage commission and salary payment schemes
wage earners are compensated on per hour basis whereas salaried workers are compensated on per week or per job basis and commission workers get paid according to how much they produce or sell
under most circumstances wage earners and lower level employees may be legally required by an employer to work more than forty hours in week however they are paid extra for the additional work
many salaried workers and commission paid sales staff are not covered by overtime laws
these are generally called exempt positions because they are exempt from federal and state laws that mandate extra pay for extra time worked
the rules are complex but generally exempt workers are executives professionals or sales staff
for example school teachers are not paid extra for working extra hours
business owners and independent contractors are considered self employed and none of these laws apply to them
generally workers are paid time and half or times the worker base wage for each hour of work past forty
california also applies this rule to work in excess of eight hours per day but exemptions and exceptions significantly limit the applicability of this law
in some states firms are required to pay double time or twice the base rate for each hour of work past or each hour of work past in one day in california also subject to numerous exemptions and exceptions
this provides an incentive for companies to limit working time but makes these additional hours more desirable for the worker
it is not uncommon for overtime hours to be accepted voluntarily by wage earning workers
unions often treat overtime as desirable commodity when negotiating how these opportunities shall be partitioned among union members
brazil brazil has hour work week normally hours per day and hours on saturday or hours per day
jobs with no meal breaks or on duty meal breaks are hours per day
public servants work hours per week
lunch breaks are one hour and are not usually counted as work
typical work schedule is or in larger cities workers eat lunch on or near their work site while some workers in smaller cities may go home for lunch
day vacation is mandated by law
holidays vary by municipality with approximately to holidays per year
mainland china china adopted hour week eliminating half day work on saturdays
however this rule has never been truly enforced and unpaid or underpaid overtime working is common practice in china traditionally chinese have worked long hours and this has led to many deaths from overwork with the state media reporting in that people were dying suddenly annually some of them were dying from overwork
despite this work hours have reportedly been falling for about three decades due to rising productivity better labor laws and the spread of the two day weekend
the trend has affected both factories and white collar companies that have been responding to growing demands for easier work schedules
the working hour system as it is known is where employees work from to six days week excluding two hours of lunch nap during the noon and one hour of supper in the evening
alibaba founder jack yun ma and jd com founder richard qiangdong liu both praise the schedule saying such schedule has helped chinese tech giants like alibaba and tencent grow to become what they are today
hong kong hong kong has no legislation regarding maximum and normal working hours
the average weekly working hours of full time employees in hong kong is hours
according to the price and earnings report conducted by ubs while the global and regional average were and hours per year respectively the average working hours in hong kong is hours per year which ranked the fifth longest yearly working hours among countries under study
in addition from the survey conducted by the public opinion study group of the university of hong kong of the respondents agree that the problem of overtime work in hong kong is severe and of the respondents support the legislation on the maximum working hours
in hong kong of surveyed do not receive any overtime remuneration
these show that people in hong kong concerns the working time issues
as hong kong implemented the minimum wage law in may the chief executive donald tsang of the special administrative region pledged that the government will standardize working hours in hong kong on november the labour department of the hksar released the report of the policy study on standard working hours
the report covers three major areas including the regimes and experience of other places in regulating working hours latest working time situations of employees in different sectors and estimation of the possible impact of introducing standard working hour in hong kong
under the selected parameters from most loosen to most stringent the estimated increase in labour cost vary from billion to billion hkd and affect of total employees to of total employees various sectors of the community show concerns about the standard working hours in hong kong
the points are summarized as below labor organizations hong kong catholic commission for labour affairs urges the government to legislate the standard working hours in hong kong and suggests hours standard hours maximum working hours in week
the organization thinks that long working time adversely affects the family and social life and health of employees it also indicates that the current employment ordinance does not regulate overtime pays working time limits nor rest day pays which can protect employees rights
businesses and related organizations generally business sector agrees that it is important to achieve work life balance but does not support legislation to regulate working hours limit
they believe standard working hours is not the best way to achieve work life balance and the root cause of the long working hours in hong kong is due to insufficient labor supply
the managing director of century environmental services group catherine yan said employees may want to work more to obtain higher salary due to financial reasons
if standard working hour legislation is passed employers will need to pay higher salary to employees and hence the employers may choose to segment work tasks to employer more part time employees instead of providing overtime pay to employees
she thinks this will lead to situation that the employees may need to find two part time jobs to earn their living making them wasting more time on transportation from one job to another the chairman of the hong kong general chamber of commerce chow chung kong believes that it is so difficult to implement standard working hours that apply across the board specifically to accountants and barristers
in addition he believes that standard working hours may decrease individual employees working hours and would not increase their actual income
it may also lead to an increase of number of part timers in the labor market
according to study conducted jointly by the business economic and public affairs research centre and enterprise and social development research centre of hong kong shue yan university surveyed companies believe that standard working hours policy can be considered and surveyed think that it would be difficult to implement standard working hours in businesses employer representative in the labour advisory board stanley lau said that standard working hours will completely alter the business environment of hong kong affect small and medium enterprise and weaken competitiveness of businesses
he believes that the government can encourage employers to pay overtime salary and there is no need to regulate standard working hours
political parties on october the legislative council members in hong kong debated on the motion legislation for the regulation of working hours
cheung kwok che proposed the motion that is the council urges the government to introduce bill on the regulation of working hours within this legislative session the contents of which must include the number of standard weekly hours and overtime pay
as the motion was not passed by both functional constituencies and geographical constituencies it was negatived the hong kong federation of trade unions suggested standard hour work week with overtime pay of times the usual pay
it believes the regulation of standard working hour can prevent the employers to force employees to work overtime without pay elizabeth quat of the democratic alliance for the betterment and progress of hong kong dab believed that standard working hours were labor policy and was not related to family friendly policies
the vice president of young dab wai hung chan stated that standard working hours would bring limitations to small and medium enterprises
he thought that the government should discuss the topic with the public more before legislating standard working hours
the democratic party suggested hour standard work week and compulsory overtime pay to help achieve the balance between work rest and entertainment of people in hong kong the labour party believed regulating working hours could help achieve work life balance
it suggests an hour work day hour standard work week hour maximum work week and an overtime pay of times the usual pay poon siu ping of federation of hong kong and kowloon labour unions thought that it is possible to set work hour limit for all industries and the regulation on working hours can ensure the overtime payment by employers to employees and protect employees health
the civic party suggests to actively study setting weekly standard working hours at hours to align with family friendly policies in legco election member of economic synergy jeffery lam believes that standard working hours would adversely affect productivity tense the employer employee relationship and increase the pressure faced by businesses who suffer from inadequate workers
he does not support the regulation on working hours at its current situation
government matthew cheung kin chung the secretary for labour and welfare bureau said the executive council has already received the government report on working hours in june and the labour advisory board and the legco manpower panel will receive the report in late november and december respectively
on november the labour department released the report and the report covered the regimes and experience of practicing standard working hours in selected regions current work hour situations in different industries and the impact assessment of standard working hours
also matthew cheung mentioned that the government will form select committee by first quarter of which will include government officials representative of labor unions and employers associations academics and community leaders to investigate the related issues
he also said that it would perhaps be unrealistic to put forward bill for standard working hours in the next one to two years
academics yip siu fai professor of the department of social work and social administration of hku has noted that professions such as nursing and accountancy have long working hours and that this may affect people social life
he believes that standard working hours could help to give hong kong more family friendly workplaces and to increase fertility rates
randy chiu professor of the department of management of hkbu has said that introducing standard working hours could avoid excessively long working hours of employees
he also said that nowadays hong kong attains almost full employment has high rental price and severe inflation recently implemented minimum wage and is affected by gloomy global economy he also mentioned that comprehensive considerations on macroeconomic situations are needed and emphasized that it is perhaps inappropriate to adopt working time regulation as exemplified in other countries to hong kong lee shu kam associate professor of the department of economics and finance of hksyu believes that standard working hours cannot deliver work life balance
he referenced the research to the us by the university of california los angeles in and pointed out that in the industries and regions in which the wage elasticity is low the effects of standard working hours on lowering actual working time and increasing wages is limited for regions where the labor supply is inadequate standard working hours can protect employees benefits yet cause unemployment but for regions such as japan where the problem does not exist standard working hours would only lead to unemployment
in addition he said the effect of standard working hours is similar to that of for example giving overtime pay making employees to favor overtime work more
in this sense introducing standard working hours does not match its principle to shorten work time and to increase the recreation time of employees
he believed that the key point is to help employees to achieve work life balance and to get win win situation of employers and employees
francis lui head and professor of the department of economics of hong kong university of science and technology believed that standard working hours may not lower work time but increase unemployment
he used japan as an example to illustrate that the implementation of standard working hours lowered productivity per head and demotivated the economy
he also said that even if the standard working hours can shorten employees weekly working hours they may need to work for more years to earn sufficient amount of money for retirement
delay their retirement age
the total working time over the course of lifetime may not change lok sang ho professor of economics and director of the centre for public policy studies of lingnan university pointed out that as different employees perform various jobs and under different degrees of pressures it may not be appropriate to establish standard working hours in hong kong and he proposed hour maximum work week to protect workers health
taiwan in taiwan had the world th longest work hour and nd in asia with the average number of work hours hit hours
there had been reduction in the work hours by from to
malaysia since september the weekly work hour in malaysia was reduced from hours to hours after it was promulgated in the dewan negara
singapore singapore has an hour normal work day hours including lunchtime hour normal working week and maximum hour work week
if the employee works no more than five days week the employee normal working day is hours and the working week is hours
also if the number of hours worked by the worker is less than hours every alternate week the hour weekly limit may be exceeded in the other week
however this is subject to the pre specification in the service contract and the maximum should not exceed hours per week or hours in any consecutive two week period
in addition shift worker can work up to hours day provided that the average working hours per week do not exceed over consecutive three week period
the overtime allowance per overtime hour must not be less than times the employee hourly basic rates
other the kapauku people of papua think it is bad luck to work two consecutive days
the kung bushmen work two and half days per week rarely more than six hours per day
the work week in samoa is approximately hours

principal component analysis pca is popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing high number of dimensions features per observation increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data
formally pca is statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of dataset
this is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into new coordinate system where most of the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data
many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points
principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics microbiome studies and atmospheric science
the principal components of collection of points in real coordinate space are sequence of unit vectors where the th vector is the direction of line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first vectors
here best fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line
these directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated
principal component analysis pca is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform change of basis on the data sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest
in data analysis the first principal component of set of variables presumed to be jointly normally distributed is the derived variable formed as linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance
the second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed and we may proceed through iterations until all the variance is explained
pca is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set
pca is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models
it is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower dimensional data while preserving as much of the data variation as possible
the first principal component can equivalently be defined as direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data
the th principal component can be taken as direction orthogonal to the first principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data
for either objective it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix
thus the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix
pca is the simplest of the true eigenvector based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis
factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of slightly different matrix
pca is also related to canonical correlation analysis cca
cca defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross covariance between two datasets while pca defines new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in single dataset
robust and norm based variants of standard pca have also been proposed
history pca was invented in by karl pearson as an analogue of the principal axis theorem in mechanics it was later independently developed and named by harold hotelling in the
depending on the field of application it is also named the discrete karhunen lo ve transform klt in signal processing the hotelling transform in multivariate quality control proper orthogonal decomposition pod in mechanical engineering singular value decomposition svd of invented in the last quarter of the th century eigenvalue decomposition evd of xtx in linear algebra factor analysis for discussion of the differences between pca and factor analysis see ch

intuition pca can be thought of as fitting dimensional ellipsoid to the data where each axis of the ellipsoid represents principal component
if some axis of the ellipsoid is small then the variance along that axis is also small
to find the axes of the ellipsoid we must first center the values of each variable in the dataset on by subtracting the mean of the variable observed values from each of those values
these transformed values are used instead of the original observed values for each of the variables
then we compute the covariance matrix of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix
then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to turn them into unit vectors
once this is done each of the mutually orthogonal unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data
this choice of basis will transform the covariance matrix into diagonalized form in which the diagonal elements represent the variance of each axis
the proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues
biplots and scree plots degree of explained variance are used to explain findings of the pca
details pca is defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate called the first principal component the second greatest variance on the second coordinate and so on consider an data matrix with column wise zero empirical mean the sample mean of each column has been shifted to zero where each of the rows represents different repetition of the experiment and each of the columns gives particular kind of feature say the results from particular sensor
mathematically the transformation is defined by set of size of dimensional vectors of weights or coefficients that map each row vector of to new vector of principal component scores given by in such way that the individual variables of considered over the data set successively inherit the maximum possible variance from with each coefficient vector constrained to be unit vector where is usually selected to be strictly less than to reduce dimensionality
first component in order to maximize variance the first weight vector thus has to satisfy arg max arg max equivalently writing this in matrix form gives arg max arg max since has been defined to be unit vector it equivalently also satisfies arg max the quantity to be maximised can be recognised as rayleigh quotient
standard result for positive semidefinite matrix such as xtx is that the quotient maximum possible value is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix which occurs when is the corresponding eigenvector
with found the first principal component of data vector can then be given as score in the transformed co ordinates or as the corresponding vector in the original variables
further components the th component can be found by subtracting the first principal components from and then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix arg max it turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of xtx with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues
thus the weight vectors are eigenvectors of xtx
the th principal component of data vector can therefore be given as score tk in the transformed coordinates or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables where is the kth eigenvector of xtx
the full principal components decomposition of can therefore be given as where is by matrix of weights whose columns are the eigenvectors of xtx
the transpose of is sometimes called the whitening or sphering transformation
columns of multiplied by the square root of corresponding eigenvalues that is eigenvectors scaled up by the variances are called loadings in pca or in factor analysis
covariances xtx itself can be recognized as proportional to the empirical sample covariance matrix of the dataset xt
the sample covariance between two of the different principal components over the dataset is given by where the eigenvalue property of has been used to move from line to line however eigenvectors and corresponding to eigenvalues of symmetric matrix are orthogonal if the eigenvalues are different or can be orthogonalised if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value
the product in the final line is therefore zero there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset
another way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix
in matrix form the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be written the empirical covariance matrix between the principal components becomes where is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of xtx
is equal to the sum of the squares over the dataset associated with each component that is tk
dimensionality reduction the transformation maps data vector from an original space of variables to new space of variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset
however not all the principal components need to be kept
keeping only the first principal components produced by using only the first eigenvectors gives the truncated transformation where the matrix tl now has rows but only columns
in other words pca learns linear transformation where the columns of matrix form an orthogonal basis for the features the components of representation that are decorrelated
by construction of all the transformed data matrices with only columns this score matrix maximises the variance in the original data that has been preserved while minimising the total squared reconstruction error or such dimensionality reduction can be very useful step for visualising and processing high dimensional datasets while still retaining as much of the variance in the dataset as possible
for example selecting and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two dimensional plane through the high dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out so if the data contains clusters these too may be most spread out and therefore most visible to be plotted out in two dimensional diagram whereas if two directions through the data or two of the original variables are chosen at random the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other making them indistinguishable
similarly in regression analysis the larger the number of explanatory variables allowed the greater is the chance of overfitting the model producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets
one approach especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables is to reduce them to few principal components and then run the regression against them method called principal component regression
dimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in dataset are noisy
if each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed gaussian noise then the columns of will also contain similarly identically distributed gaussian noise such distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix which can be thought of as high dimensional rotation of the co ordinate axes
however with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance the proportionate effect of the noise is less the first few components achieve higher signal to noise ratio
pca thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction while the later principal components may be dominated by noise and so disposed of without great loss
if the dataset is not too large the significance of the principal components can be tested using parametric bootstrap as an aid in determining how many principal components to retain
singular value decomposition the principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization the singular value decomposition svd of here is an by rectangular diagonal matrix of positive numbers called the singular values of is an by matrix the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length called the left singular vectors of and is by whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length and called the right singular vectors of in terms of this factorization the matrix xtx can be written where is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values of and the excess zeros chopped off that satisfies comparison with the eigenvector factorization of xtx establishes that the right singular vectors of are equivalent to the eigenvectors of xtx while the singular values of are equal to the square root of the eigenvalues of xtx
using the singular value decomposition the score matrix can be written so each column of is given by one of the left singular vectors of multiplied by the corresponding singular value
this form is also the polar decomposition of efficient algorithms exist to calculate the svd of without having to form the matrix xtx so computing the svd is now the standard way to calculate principal components analysis from data matrix unless only handful of components are required
as with the eigen decomposition truncated score matrix tl can be obtained by considering only the first largest singular values and their singular vectors the truncation of matrix or using truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of rank to the original matrix in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible frobenius norm result known as the eckart young theorem
further considerations the singular values in are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix xtx
each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the variance more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean that is associated with each eigenvector
the sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean
pca essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components
this moves as much of the variance as possible using an orthogonal transformation into the first few dimensions
the values in the remaining dimensions therefore tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information see below
pca is often used in this manner for dimensionality reduction
pca has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest variance as defined above
this advantage however comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared for example and when applicable to the discrete cosine transform and in particular to the dct ii which is simply known as the dct
nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than pca
pca is sensitive to the scaling of the variables
if we have just two variables and they have the same sample variance and are completely correlated then the pca will entail rotation by and the weights they are the cosines of rotation for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal
but if we multiply all values of the first variable by then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable with small contribution from the other variable whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable
this means that whenever the different variables have different units like temperature and mass pca is somewhat arbitrary method of analysis
different results would be obtained if one used fahrenheit rather than celsius for example
pearson original paper was entitled on lines and planes of closest fit to systems of points in space in space implies physical euclidean space where such concerns do not arise
one way of making the pca less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as basis for pca
however this compresses or expands the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance
mean centering is necessary for performing classical pca to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance
if mean subtraction is not performed the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data
mean of zero is needed for finding basis that minimizes the mean square error of the approximation of the data mean centering is unnecessary if performing principal components analysis on correlation matrix as the data are already centered after calculating correlations
correlations are derived from the cross product of two standard scores scores or statistical moments hence the name pearson product moment correlation
also see the article by kromrey foster johnson on mean centering in moderated regression much ado about nothing
since covariances are correlations of normalized variables or standard scores pca based on the correlation matrix of is equal to pca based on the covariance matrix of the standardized version of pca is popular primary technique in pattern recognition
it is not however optimized for class separability
however it has been used to quantify the distance between two or more classes by calculating center of mass for each class in principal component space and reporting euclidean distance between center of mass of two or more classes
the linear discriminant analysis is an alternative which is optimized for class separability
table of symbols and abbreviations properties and limitations of pca properties some properties of pca include property for any integer consider the orthogonal linear transformation where is element vector and is matrix and let be the variance covariance matrix for then the trace of denoted tr is maximized by taking where consists of the first columns of is the transpose of property consider again the orthonormal transformation with and defined as before
then tr is minimized by taking where consists of the last columns of the statistical implication of this property is that the last few pcs are not simply unstructured left overs after removing the important pcs
because these last pcs have variances as small as possible they are useful in their own right
they can help to detect unsuspected near constant linear relationships between the elements of and they may also be useful in regression in selecting subset of variables from and in outlier detection
property spectral decomposition of before we look at its usage we first look at diagonal elements var then perhaps the main statistical implication of the result is that not only can we decompose the combined variances of all the elements of into decreasing contributions due to each pc but we can also decompose the whole covariance matrix into contributions from each pc
although not strictly decreasing the elements of will tend to become smaller as increases as is nonincreasing for increasing whereas the elements of tend to stay about the same size because of the normalization constraints limitations as noted above the results of pca depend on the scaling of the variables
this can be cured by scaling each feature by its standard deviation so that one ends up with dimensionless features with unital variance the applicability of pca as described above is limited by certain tacit assumptions made in its derivation
in particular pca can capture linear correlations between the features but fails when this assumption is violated see figure in the reference
in some cases coordinate transformations can restore the linearity assumption and pca can then be applied see kernel pca
another limitation is the mean removal process before constructing the covariance matrix for pca
in fields such as astronomy all the signals are non negative and the mean removal process will force the mean of some astrophysical exposures to be zero which consequently creates unphysical negative fluxes and forward modeling has to be performed to recover the true magnitude of the signals
as an alternative method non negative matrix factorization focusing only on the non negative elements in the matrices which is well suited for astrophysical observations
see more at relation between pca and non negative matrix factorization
pca is at disadvantage if the data has not been standardized before applying the algorithm to it
pca transforms original data into data that is relevant to the principal components of that data which means that the new data variables cannot be interpreted in the same ways that the originals were
they are linear interpretations of the original variables
also if pca is not performed properly there is high likelihood of information loss pca relies on linear model
if dataset has pattern hidden inside it that is nonlinear then pca can actually steer the analysis in the complete opposite direction of progress
researchers at kansas state university discovered that the sampling error in their experiments impacted the bias of pca results
if the number of subjects or blocks is smaller than and or the researcher is interested in pc beyond the first it may be better to first correct for the serial correlation before pca is conducted
the researchers at kansas state also found that pca could be seriously biased if the autocorrelation structure of the data is not correctly handled
pca and information theory dimensionality reduction results in loss of information in general
pca based dimensionality reduction tends to minimize that information loss under certain signal and noise models
under the assumption that that is that the data vector is the sum of the desired information bearing signal and noise signal one can show that pca can be optimal for dimensionality reduction from an information theoretic point of view
in particular linsker showed that if is gaussian and is gaussian noise with covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix the pca maximizes the mutual information between the desired information and the dimensionality reduced output if the noise is still gaussian and has covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix that is the components of the vector are iid but the information bearing signal is non gaussian which is common scenario pca at least minimizes an upper bound on the information loss which is defined as
the optimality of pca is also preserved if the noise is iid and at least more gaussian in terms of the kullback leibler divergence than the information bearing signal in general even if the above signal model holds pca loses its information theoretic optimality as soon as the noise becomes dependent
computing pca using the covariance method the following is detailed description of pca using the covariance method see also here as opposed to the correlation method the goal is to transform given data set of dimension to an alternative data set of smaller dimension equivalently we are seeking to find the matrix where is the karhunen lo ve transform klt of matrix organize the data setsuppose you have data comprising set of observations of variables and you want to reduce the data so that each observation can be described with only variables suppose further that the data are arranged as set of data vectors with each representing single grouped observation of the variables
write as row vectors each with elements
place the row vectors into single matrix of dimensions calculate the empirical meanfind the empirical mean along each column place the calculated mean values into an empirical mean vector of dimensions calculate the deviations from the meanmean subtraction is an integral part of the solution towards finding principal component basis that minimizes the mean square error of approximating the data
hence we proceed by centering the data as follows subtract the empirical mean vector from each row of the data matrix store mean subtracted data in the matrix where is an column vector of all for in some applications each variable column of may also be scaled to have variance equal to see score
this step affects the calculated principal components but makes them independent of the units used to measure the different variables
find the covariance matrixfind the empirical covariance matrix from matrix where is the conjugate transpose operator
if consists entirely of real numbers which is the case in many applications the conjugate transpose is the same as the regular transpose
the reasoning behind using instead of to calculate the covariance is bessel correction find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrixcompute the matrix of eigenvectors which diagonalizes the covariance matrix where is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of this step will typically involve the use of computer based algorithm for computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues
these algorithms are readily available as sub components of most matrix algebra systems such as sas matlab mathematica scipy idl interactive data language or gnu octave as well as opencv
matrix will take the form of an diagonal matrix where is the jth eigenvalue of the covariance matrix and matrix also of dimension contains column vectors each of length which represent the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are ordered and paired
the jth eigenvalue corresponds to the jth eigenvector
matrix denotes the matrix of right eigenvectors as opposed to left eigenvectors
in general the matrix of right eigenvectors need not be the conjugate transpose of the matrix of left eigenvectors rearrange the eigenvectors and eigenvaluessort the columns of the eigenvector matrix and eigenvalue matrix in order of decreasing eigenvalue
make sure to maintain the correct pairings between the columns in each matrix compute the cumulative energy content for each eigenvectorthe eigenvalues represent the distribution of the source data energy among each of the eigenvectors where the eigenvectors form basis for the data
the cumulative energy content for the jth eigenvector is the sum of the energy content across all of the eigenvalues from through for select subset of the eigenvectors as basis vectorssave the first columns of as the matrix where use the vector as guide in choosing an appropriate value for the goal is to choose value of as small as possible while achieving reasonably high value of on percentage basis
for example you may want to choose so that the cumulative energy is above certain threshold like percent
in this case choose the smallest value of such that project the data onto the new basisthe projected data points are the rows of the matrix that is the first column of is the projection of the data points onto the first principal component the second column is the projection onto the second principal component etc
derivation of pca using the covariance method let be dimensional random vector expressed as column vector
without loss of generality assume has zero mean
we want to find orthonormal transformation matrix so that px has diagonal covariance matrix that is px is random vector with all its distinct components pairwise uncorrelated
quick computation assuming were unitary yields cov cov hence holds if and only if cov were diagonalisable by this is very constructive as cov is guaranteed to be non negative definite matrix and thus is guaranteed to be diagonalisable by some unitary matrix
covariance free computation in practical implementations especially with high dimensional data large the naive covariance method is rarely used because it is not efficient due to high computational and memory costs of explicitly determining the covariance matrix
the covariance free approach avoids the np operations of explicitly calculating and storing the covariance matrix xtx instead utilizing one of matrix free methods for example based on the function evaluating the product xt at the cost of np operations
iterative computation one way to compute the first principal component efficiently is shown in the following pseudo code for data matrix with zero mean without ever computing its covariance matrix
random vector of length norm do times vector of length for each row in rts is the eigenvalue error norm exit if error tolerance return this power iteration algorithm simply calculates the vector xt normalizes and places the result back in the eigenvalue is approximated by rt xtx which is the rayleigh quotient on the unit vector for the covariance matrix xtx
if the largest singular value is well separated from the next largest one the vector gets close to the first principal component of within the number of iterations which is small relative to at the total cost cnp
the power iteration convergence can be accelerated without noticeably sacrificing the small cost per iteration using more advanced matrix free methods such as the lanczos algorithm or the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient lobpcg method
subsequent principal components can be computed one by one via deflation or simultaneously as block
in the former approach imprecisions in already computed approximate principal components additively affect the accuracy of the subsequently computed principal components thus increasing the error with every new computation
the latter approach in the block power method replaces single vectors and with block vectors matrices and every column of approximates one of the leading principal components while all columns are iterated simultaneously
the main calculation is evaluation of the product xt
implemented for example in lobpcg efficient blocking eliminates the accumulation of the errors allows using high level blas matrix matrix product functions and typically leads to faster convergence compared to the single vector one by one technique
the nipals method non linear iterative partial least squares nipals is variant the classical power iteration with matrix deflation by subtraction implemented for computing the first few components in principal component or partial least squares analysis
for very high dimensional datasets such as those generated in the omics sciences for example genomics metabolomics it is usually only necessary to compute the first few pcs
the non linear iterative partial least squares nipals algorithm updates iterative approximations to the leading scores and loadings and by the power iteration multiplying on every iteration by on the left and on the right that is calculation of the covariance matrix is avoided just as in the matrix free implementation of the power iterations to xtx based on the function evaluating the product xt tx the matrix deflation by subtraction is performed by subtracting the outer product from leaving the deflated residual matrix used to calculate the subsequent leading pcs
for large data matrices or matrices that have high degree of column collinearity nipals suffers from loss of orthogonality of pcs due to machine precision round off errors accumulated in each iteration and matrix deflation by subtraction
gram schmidt re orthogonalization algorithm is applied to both the scores and the loadings at each iteration step to eliminate this loss of orthogonality
nipals reliance on single vector multiplications cannot take advantage of high level blas and results in slow convergence for clustered leading singular values both these deficiencies are resolved in more sophisticated matrix free block solvers such as the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient lobpcg method
online sequential estimation in an online or streaming situation with data arriving piece by piece rather than being stored in single batch it is useful to make an estimate of the pca projection that can be updated sequentially
this can be done efficiently but requires different algorithms
pca and qualitative variables in pca it is common that we want to introduce qualitative variables as supplementary elements
for example many quantitative variables have been measured on plants
for these plants some qualitative variables are available as for example the species to which the plant belongs
these data were subjected to pca for quantitative variables
when analyzing the results it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable species
for this the following results are produced
identification on the factorial planes of the different species for example using different colors
representation on the factorial planes of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species
for each center of gravity and each axis value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin these results are what is called introducing qualitative variable as supplementary element
this procedure is detailed in and husson pag and pag few software offer this option in an automatic way
this is the case of spad that historically following the work of ludovic lebart was the first to propose this option and the package factominer
applications intelligence the earliest application of factor analysis was in locating and measuring components of human intelligence
it was believed that intelligence had various uncorrelated components such as spatial intelligence verbal intelligence induction deduction etc and that scores on these could be adduced by factor analysis from results on various tests to give single index known as the intelligence quotient iq
the pioneering statistical psychologist spearman actually developed factor analysis in for his two factor theory of intelligence adding formal technique to the science of psychometrics
in thurstone looked for factors of intelligence developing the notion of mental age
standard iq tests today are based on this early work
residential differentiation in shevky and williams introduced the theory of factorial ecology which dominated studies of residential differentiation from the to the
neighbourhoods in city were recognizable or could be distinguished from one another by various characteristics which could be reduced to three by factor analysis
these were known as social rank an index of occupational status familism or family size and ethnicity cluster analysis could then be applied to divide the city into clusters or precincts according to values of the three key factor variables
an extensive literature developed around factorial ecology in urban geography but the approach went out of fashion after as being methodologically primitive and having little place in postmodern geographical paradigms
one of the problems with factor analysis has always been finding convincing names for the various artificial factors
in flood revived the factorial ecology approach to show that principal components analysis actually gave meaningful answers directly without resorting to factor rotation
the principal components were actually dual variables or shadow prices of forces pushing people together or apart in cities
the first component was accessibility the classic trade off between demand for travel and demand for space around which classical urban economics is based
the next two components were disadvantage which keeps people of similar status in separate neighbourhoods mediated by planning and ethnicity where people of similar ethnic backgrounds try to co locate about the same time the australian bureau of statistics defined distinct indexes of advantage and disadvantage taking the first principal component of sets of key variables that were thought to be important
these seifa indexes are regularly published for various jurisdictions and are used frequently in spatial analysis
development indexes pca has been the only formal method available for the development of indexes which are otherwise hit or miss ad hoc undertaking
the city development index was developed by pca from about indicators of city outcomes in survey of global cities
the first principal component was subject to iterative regression adding the original variables singly until about of its variation was accounted for
the index ultimately used about indicators but was good predictor of many more variables
its comparative value agreed very well with subjective assessment of the condition of each city
the coefficients on items of infrastructure were roughly proportional to the average costs of providing the underlying services suggesting the index was actually measure of effective physical and social investment in the city
the country level human development index hdi from undp which has been published since and is very extensively used in development studies has very similar coefficients on similar indicators strongly suggesting it was originally constructed using pca
population genetics in cavalli sforza and others pioneered the use of principal components analysis pca to summarise data on variation in human gene frequencies across regions
the components showed distinctive patterns including gradients and sinusoidal waves
they interpreted these patterns as resulting from specific ancient migration events
since then pca has been ubiquitous in population genetics with thousands of papers using pca as display mechanism
genetics varies largely according to proximity so the first two principal components actually show spatial distribution and may be used to map the relative geographical location of different population groups thereby showing individuals who have wandered from their original locations pca in genetics has been technically controversial in that the technique has been performed on discrete non normal variables and often on binary allele markers
the lack of any measures of standard error in pca are also an impediment to more consistent usage
in august the molecular biologist eran elhaik published theoretical paper in scientific reports analyzing pca applications
he concluded that it was easy to manipulate the method which in his view generated results that were erroneous contradictory and absurd
specifically he argued the results achieved in population genetics were characterized by cherry picking and circular reasoning
market research and indexes of attitude market research has been an extensive user of pca
it is used to develop customer satisfaction or customer loyalty scores for products and with clustering to develop market segments that may be targeted with advertising campaigns in much the same way as factorial ecology will locate geographical areas with similar characteristics pca rapidly transforms large amounts of data into smaller easier to digest variables that can be more rapidly and readily analyzed
in any consumer questionnaire there are series of questions designed to elicit consumer attitudes and principal components seek out latent variables underlying these attitudes
for example the oxford internet survey in asked people about their attitudes and beliefs and from these analysts extracted four principal component dimensions which they identified as escape social networking efficiency and problem creating another example from joe flood in extracted an attitudinal index toward housing from attitude questions in national survey of households in australia
the first principal component represented general attitude toward property and home ownership
the index or the attitude questions it embodied could be fed into general linear model of tenure choice
the strongest determinant of private renting by far was the attitude index rather than income marital status or household type
quantitative finance in quantitative finance principal component analysis can be directly applied to the risk management of interest rate derivative portfolios
trading multiple swap instruments which are usually function of other market quotable swap instruments is sought to be reduced to usually or principal components representing the path of interest rates on macro basis
converting risks to be represented as those to factor loadings or multipliers provides assessments and understanding beyond that available to simply collectively viewing risks to individual buckets
pca has also been applied to equity portfolios in similar fashion both to portfolio risk and to risk return
one application is to reduce portfolio risk where allocation strategies are applied to the principal portfolios instead of the underlying stocks
second is to enhance portfolio return using the principal components to select stocks with upside potential
neuroscience variant of principal components analysis is used in neuroscience to identify the specific properties of stimulus that increases neuron probability of generating an action potential
this technique is known as spike triggered covariance analysis
in typical application an experimenter presents white noise process as stimulus usually either as sensory input to test subject or as current injected directly into the neuron and records train of action potentials or spikes produced by the neuron as result
presumably certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike
in order to extract these features the experimenter calculates the covariance matrix of the spike triggered ensemble the set of all stimuli defined and discretized over finite time window typically on the order of ms that immediately preceded spike
the eigenvectors of the difference between the spike triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the prior stimulus ensemble the set of all stimuli defined over the same length time window then indicate the directions in the space of stimuli along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble
specifically the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the varince of the prior
since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to spike they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features
in neuroscience pca is also used to discern the identity of neuron from the shape of its action potential
spike sorting is an important procedure because extracellular recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron
in spike sorting one first uses pca to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms and then performs clustering analysis to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons
pca as dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles
it has been used in determining collective variables that is order parameters during phase transitions in the brain
relation with other methods correspondence analysis correspondence analysis ca was developed by jean paul benz cri and is conceptually similar to pca but scales the data which should be non negative so that rows and columns are treated equivalently
it is traditionally applied to contingency tables
ca decomposes the chi squared statistic associated to this table into orthogonal factors
because ca is descriptive technique it can be applied to tables for which the chi squared statistic is appropriate or not
several variants of ca are available including detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis
one special extension is multiple correspondence analysis which may be seen as the counterpart of principal component analysis for categorical data
factor analysis principal component analysis creates variables that are linear combinations of the original variables
the new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal
the pca transformation can be helpful as pre processing step before clustering
pca is variance focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable
pca is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction that is translating variable space into optimal factor space but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors
factor analysis is similar to principal component analysis in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables
different from pca factor analysis is correlation focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter correlations among variables in which the factors represent the common variance of variables excluding unique variance
in terms of the correlation matrix this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off diagonal terms that is shared co variance while pca focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal
however as side result when trying to reproduce the on diagonal terms pca also tends to fit relatively well the off diagonal correlations
results given by pca and factor analysis are very similar in most situations but this is not always the case and there are some problems where the results are significantly different
factor analysis is generally used when the research purpose is detecting data structure that is latent constructs or factors or causal modeling
if the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met then factor analysis will give erroneous results
means clustering it has been asserted that the relaxed solution of means clustering specified by the cluster indicators is given by the principal components and the pca subspace spanned by the principal directions is identical to the cluster centroid subspace
however that pca is useful relaxation of means clustering was not new result and it is straightforward to uncover counterexamples to the statement that the cluster centroid subspace is spanned by the principal directions
non negative matrix factorization non negative matrix factorization nmf is dimension reduction method where only non negative elements in the matrices are used which is therefore promising method in astronomy in the sense that astrophysical signals are non negative
the pca components are orthogonal to each other while the nmf components are all non negative and therefore constructs non orthogonal basis
in pca the contribution of each component is ranked based on the magnitude of its corresponding eigenvalue which is equivalent to the fractional residual variance frv in analyzing empirical data
for nmf its components are ranked based only on the empirical frv curves
the residual fractional eigenvalue plots that is as function of component number given total of components for pca has flat plateau where no data is captured to remove the quasi static noise then the curves dropped quickly as an indication of over fitting and captures random noise
the frv curves for nmf is decreasing continuously when the nmf components are constructed sequentially indicating the continuous capturing of quasi static noise then converge to higher levels than pca indicating the less over fitting property of nmf
iconography of correlations it is often difficult to interpret the principal components when the data include many variables of various origins or when some variables are qualitative
this leads the pca user to delicate elimination of several variables
if observations or variables have an excessive impact on the direction of the axes they should be removed and then projected as supplementary elements
in addition it is necessary to avoid interpreting the proximities between the points close to the center of the factorial plane
the iconography of correlations on the contrary which is not projection on system of axes does not have these drawbacks
we can therefore keep all the variables
the principle of the diagram is to underline the remarkable correlations of the correlation matrix by solid line positive correlation or dotted line negative correlation
strong correlation is not remarkable if it is not direct but caused by the effect of third variable
conversely weak correlations can be remarkable
for example if variable depends on several independent variables the correlations of with each of them are weak and yet remarkable
generalizations sparse pca particular disadvantage of pca is that the principal components are usually linear combinations of all input variables
sparse pca overcomes this disadvantage by finding linear combinations that contain just few input variables
it extends the classic method of principal component analysis pca for the reduction of dimensionality of data by adding sparsity constraint on the input variables
several approaches have been proposed including regression framework convex relaxation semidefinite programming framework generalized power method framework an alternating maximization framework forward backward greedy search and exact methods using branch and bound techniques bayesian formulation framework the methodological and theoretical developments of sparse pca as well as its applications in scientific studies were recently reviewed in survey paper
nonlinear pca most of the modern methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction find their theoretical and algorithmic roots in pca or means
pearson original idea was to take straight line or plane which will be the best fit to set of data points
trevor hastie expanded on this concept by proposing principal curves as the natural extension for the geometric interpretation of pca which explicitly constructs manifold for data approximation followed by projecting the points onto it as is illustrated by fig
see also the elastic map algorithm and principal geodesic analysis
another popular generalization is kernel pca which corresponds to pca performed in reproducing kernel hilbert space associated with positive definite kernel
in multilinear subspace learning pca is generalized to multilinear pca mpca that extracts features directly from tensor representations
mpca is solved by performing pca in each mode of the tensor iteratively
mpca has been applied to face recognition gait recognition etc
mpca is further extended to uncorrelated mpca non negative mpca and robust mpca
way principal component analysis may be performed with models such as tucker decomposition parafac multiple factor analysis co inertia analysis statis and distatis
robust pca while pca finds the mathematically optimal method as in minimizing the squared error it is still sensitive to outliers in the data that produce large errors something that the method tries to avoid in the first place
it is therefore common practice to remove outliers before computing pca
however in some contexts outliers can be difficult to identify
for example in data mining algorithms like correlation clustering the assignment of points to clusters and outliers is not known beforehand
recently proposed generalization of pca based on weighted pca increases robustness by assigning different weights to data objects based on their estimated relevancy
outlier resistant variants of pca have also been proposed based on norm formulations pca robust principal component analysis rpca via decomposition in low rank and sparse matrices is modification of pca that works well with respect to grossly corrupted observations
similar techniques independent component analysis independent component analysis ica is directed to similar problems as principal component analysis but finds additively separable components rather than successive approximations
network component analysis given matrix it tries to decompose it into two matrices such that key difference from techniques such as pca and ica is that some of the entries of are constrained to be here is termed the regulatory layer
while in general such decomposition can have multiple solutions they prove that if the following conditions are satisfied has full column rank each column of must have at least zeroes where is the number of columns of or alternatively the number of rows of
the justification for this criterion is that if node is removed from the regulatory layer along with all the output nodes connected to it the result must still be characterized by connectivity matrix with full column rank
must have full row rank then the decomposition is unique up to multiplication by scalar
discriminant analysis of principal components discriminant analysis of principal components dapc is multivariate method used to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals
genetic variation is partitioned into two components variation between groups and within groups and it maximizes the former
linear discriminants are linear combinations of alleles which best separate the clusters
alleles that most contribute to this discrimination are therefore those that are the most markedly different across groups
the contributions of alleles to the groupings identified by dapc can allow identifying regions of the genome driving the genetic divergence among groups in dapc data is first transformed using principal components analysis pca and subsequently clusters are identified using discriminant analysis da

in linear algebra rotation matrix is transformation matrix that is used to perform rotation in euclidean space
for example using the convention below the matrix cos sin sin cos rotates points in the xy plane counterclockwise through an angle with respect to the positive axis about the origin of two dimensional cartesian coordinate system
to perform the rotation on plane point with standard coordinates it should be written as column vector and multiplied by the matrix cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos
if and are the endpoint coordinates of vector where is cosine and is sine then the above equations become the trigonometric summation angle formulae
indeed rotation matrix can be seen as the trigonometric summation angle formulae in matrix form
one way to understand this is say we have vector at an angle from the axis and we wish to rotate that angle by further
we simply need to compute the vector endpoint coordinates at
the examples in this article apply to active rotations of vectors counterclockwise in right handed coordinate system counterclockwise from by pre multiplication on the left
if any one of these is changed such as rotating axes instead of vectors passive transformation then the inverse of the example matrix should be used which coincides with its transpose
since matrix multiplication has no effect on the zero vector the coordinates of the origin rotation matrices describe rotations about the origin
rotation matrices provide an algebraic description of such rotations and are used extensively for computations in geometry physics and computer graphics
in some literature the term rotation is generalized to include improper rotations characterized by orthogonal matrices with determinant of instead of
these combine proper rotations with reflections which invert orientation
in other cases where reflections are not being considered the label proper may be dropped
the latter convention is followed in this article
rotation matrices are square matrices with real entries
more specifically they can be characterized as orthogonal matrices with determinant that is square matrix is rotation matrix if and only if rt and det the set of all orthogonal matrices of size with determinant is representation of group known as the special orthogonal group so one example of which is the rotation group so
the set of all orthogonal matrices of size with determinant or is representation of the general orthogonal group
in two dimensions in two dimensions the standard rotation matrix has the following form cos sin sin cos
this rotates column vectors by means of the following matrix multiplication cos sin sin cos
thus the new coordinates of point after rotation are cos sin sin cos
examples for example when the vector is rotated by an angle its new coordinates are cos sin and when the vector is rotated by an angle its new coordinates are sin cos
direction the direction of vector rotation is counterclockwise if is positive
and clockwise if is negative
thus the clockwise rotation matrix is found as cos sin sin cos
the two dimensional case is the only non trivial
not one dimensional case where the rotation matrices group is commutative so that it does not matter in which order multiple rotations are performed
an alternative convention uses rotating axes and the above matrices also represent rotation of the axes clockwise through an angle
non standard orientation of the coordinate system if standard right handed cartesian coordinate system is used with the axis to the right and the axis up the rotation is counterclockwise
if left handed cartesian coordinate system is used with directed to the right but directed down is clockwise
such non standard orientations are rarely used in mathematics but are common in computer graphics which often have the origin in the top left corner and the axis down the screen or page see below for other alternative conventions which may change the sense of the rotation produced by rotation matrix
common rotations particularly useful are the matrices for and counter clockwise rotations
relationship with complex plane since the matrices of the shape form ring isomorphic to the field of the complex numbers under this isomorphism the rotation matrices correspond to circle of the unit complex numbers the complex numbers of modulus if one identifies with through the linear isomorphism the action of matrix of the above form on vectors of corresponds to the multiplication by the complex number iy and rotations correspond to multiplication by complex numbers of modulus as every rotation matrix can be written cos sin sin cos the above correspondence associates such matrix with the complex number cos sin this last equality is euler formula
in three dimensions basic rotations basic rotation also called elemental rotation is rotation about one of the axes of coordinate system
the following three basic rotation matrices rotate vectors by an angle about the or axis in three dimensions using the right hand rule which codifies their alternating signs
the same matrices can also represent clockwise rotation of the axes
cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos for column vectors each of these basic vector rotations appears counterclockwise when the axis about which they occur points toward the observer the coordinate system is right handed and the angle is positive
rz for instance would rotate toward the axis vector aligned with the axis as can easily be checked by operating with rz on the vector cos sin sin cos this is similar to the rotation produced by the above mentioned two dimensional rotation matrix
see below for alternative conventions which may apparently or actually invert the sense of the rotation produced by these matrices
general rotations other rotation matrices can be obtained from these three using matrix multiplication
for example the product cos sin sin cos yaw cos sin sin cos pitch cos sin sin cos roll cos cos cos sin sin sin cos cos sin cos sin sin sin cos sin sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos sin cos cos represents rotation whose yaw pitch and roll angles are and respectively
more formally it is an intrinsic rotation whose tait bryan angles are about axes respectively
similarly the product cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos cos sin sin cos cos sin cos sin cos sin sin cos sin sin sin sin cos cos cos sin sin sin cos sin sin cos cos cos represents an extrinsic rotation whose improper euler angles are about axes these matrices produce the desired effect only if they are used to premultiply column vectors and since in general matrix multiplication is not commutative only if they are applied in the specified order see ambiguities for more details
the order of rotation operations is from right to left the matrix adjacent to the column vector is the first to be applied and then the one to the left
conversion from rotation matrix to axis angle every rotation in three dimensions is defined by its axis vector along this axis is unchanged by the rotation and its angle the amount of rotation about that axis euler rotation theorem
there are several methods to compute the axis and angle from rotation matrix see also axis angle representation
here we only describe the method based on the computation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the rotation matrix
it is also possible to use the trace of the rotation matrix
determining the axis given rotation matrix vector parallel to the rotation axis must satisfy since the rotation of around the rotation axis must result in the equation above may be solved for which is unique up to scalar factor unless further the equation may be rewritten which shows that lies in the null space of viewed in another way is an eigenvector of corresponding to the eigenvalue every rotation matrix must have this eigenvalue the other two eigenvalues being complex conjugates of each other
it follows that general rotation matrix in three dimensions has up to multiplicative constant only one real eigenvector
one way to determine the rotation axis is by showing that since rt is skew symmetric matrix we can choose such that
the matrix vector product becomes cross product of vector with itself ensuring that the result is zero therefore if then
the magnitude of computed this way is sin where is the angle of rotation
this does not work if is symmetric
above if rt is zero then all subsequent steps are invalid
in this case it is necessary to diagonalize and find the eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of
determining the angle to find the angle of rotation once the axis of the rotation is known select vector perpendicular to the axis
then the angle of the rotation is the angle between and rv
more direct method however is to simply calculate the trace the sum of the diagonal elements of the rotation matrix
care should be taken to select the right sign for the angle to match the chosen axis tr cos from which follows that the angle absolute value is arccos tr
rotation matrix from axis and angle the matrix of proper rotation by angle around the axis ux uy uz unit vector with is given by cos cos cos sin cos sin cos sin cos cos cos sin cos sin cos sin cos cos
derivation of this matrix from first principles can be found in section here
the basic idea to derive this matrix is dividing the problem into few known simple steps
first rotate the given axis and the point such that the axis lies in one of the coordinate planes xy yz or zx then rotate the given axis and the point such that the axis is aligned with one of the two coordinate axes for that particular coordinate plane or use one of the fundamental rotation matrices to rotate the point depending on the coordinate axis with which the rotation axis is aligned
reverse rotate the axis point pair such that it attains the final configuration as that was in step undoing step reverse rotate the axis point pair which was done in step undoing step this can be written more concisely as cos sin cos where is the cross product matrix of the expression is the outer product and is the identity matrix
alternatively the matrix entries are cos sin if sin sin if where jkl is the levi civita symbol with this is matrix form of rodrigues rotation formula or the equivalent differently parametrized euler rodrigues formula with
in the rotation of vector around the axis by an angle can be written as cos sin if the space is right handed and this rotation will be counterclockwise when points towards the observer right hand rule
explicitly with right handed orthonormal basis cos sin sin cos note the striking merely apparent differences to the equivalent lie algebraic formulation below
properties for any dimensional rotation matrix acting on the rotation is an orthogonal matrix it follows that det rotation is termed proper if det and improper or roto reflection if det
for even dimensions the eigenvalues of proper rotation occur as pairs of complex conjugates which are roots of unity for which is real only for
therefore there may be no vectors fixed by the rotation and thus no axis of rotation
any fixed eigenvectors occur in pairs and the axis of rotation is an even dimensional subspace
for odd dimensions proper rotation will have an odd number of eigenvalues with at least one and the axis of rotation will be an odd dimensional subspace
proof det det det det det det det det
here is the identity matrix and we use det rt det as well as since is odd
therefore det meaning there is null vector with that is rv fixed eigenvector
there may also be pairs of fixed eigenvectors in the even dimensional subspace orthogonal to so the total dimension of fixed eigenvectors is odd
for example in space rotation by angle has eigenvalues ei and so there is no axis of rotation except when the case of the null rotation
in space the axis of non null proper rotation is always unique line and rotation around this axis by angle has eigenvalues ei
in space the four eigenvalues are of the form
the null rotation has the case of is called simple rotation with two unit eigenvalues forming an axis plane and two dimensional rotation orthogonal to the axis plane
otherwise there is no axis plane
the case of is called an isoclinic rotation having eigenvalues repeated twice so every vector is rotated through an angle the trace of rotation matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues
for rotation by angle has trace cos for rotation around any axis by angle has trace cos for and the trace is cos cos which becomes cos for an isoclinic rotation
examples geometry in euclidean geometry rotation is an example of an isometry transformation that moves points without changing the distances between them
rotations are distinguished from other isometries by two additional properties they leave at least one point fixed and they leave handedness unchanged
in contrast translation moves every point reflection exchanges left and right handed ordering glide reflection does both and an improper rotation combines change in handedness with normal rotation
if fixed point is taken as the origin of cartesian coordinate system then every point can be given coordinates as displacement from the origin
thus one may work with the vector space of displacements instead of the points themselves
now suppose pn are the coordinates of the vector from the origin to point choose an orthonormal basis for our coordinates then the squared distance to by pythagoras is which can be computed using the matrix multiplication geometric rotation transforms lines to lines and preserves ratios of distances between points
from these properties it can be shown that rotation is linear transformation of the vectors and thus can be written in matrix form qp
the fact that rotation preserves not just ratios but distances themselves is stated as or because this equation holds for all vectors one concludes that every rotation matrix satisfies the orthogonality condition rotations preserve handedness because they cannot change the ordering of the axes which implies the special matrix condition det equally important it can be shown that any matrix satisfying these two conditions acts as rotation
multiplication the inverse of rotation matrix is its transpose which is also rotation matrix det det the product of two rotation matrices is rotation matrix det det det for multiplication of rotation matrices is generally not commutative
noting that any identity matrix is rotation matrix and that matrix multiplication is associative we may summarize all these properties by saying that the rotation matrices form group which for is non abelian called special orthogonal group and denoted by so so son or son the group of rotation matrices is isomorphic to the group of rotations in an dimensional space
this means that multiplication of rotation matrices corresponds to composition of rotations applied in left to right order of their corresponding matrices
ambiguities the interpretation of rotation matrix can be subject to many ambiguities
in most cases the effect of the ambiguity is equivalent to the effect of rotation matrix inversion for these orthogonal matrices equivalently matrix transpose
alias or alibi passive or active transformation the coordinates of point may change due to either rotation of the coordinate system cs alias or rotation of the point alibi
in the latter case the rotation of also produces rotation of the vector representing in other words either and are fixed while cs rotates alias or cs is fixed while and rotate alibi
any given rotation can be legitimately described both ways as vectors and coordinate systems actually rotate with respect to each other about the same axis but in opposite directions
throughout this article we chose the alibi approach to describe rotations
for instance cos sin sin cos represents counterclockwise rotation of vector by an angle or rotation of cs by the same angle but in the opposite direction
alibi and alias transformations are also known as active and passive transformations respectively
pre multiplication or post multiplication the same point can be represented either by column vector or row vector rotation matrices can either pre multiply column vectors rv or post multiply row vectors wr
however rv produces rotation in the opposite direction with respect to wr
throughout this article rotations produced on column vectors are described by means of pre multiplication
to obtain exactly the same rotation
the same final coordinates of point the equivalent row vector must be post multiplied by the transpose of
right or left handed coordinates the matrix and the vector can be represented with respect to right handed or left handed coordinate system
throughout the article we assumed right handed orientation unless otherwise specified
vectors or forms the vector space has dual space of linear forms and the matrix can act on either vectors or forms
decompositions independent planes consider the rotation matrix
if acts in certain direction purely as scaling by factor then we have so that thus is root of the characteristic polynomial for det
two features are noteworthy
first one of the roots or eigenvalues is which tells us that some direction is unaffected by the matrix
for rotations in three dimensions this is the axis of the rotation concept that has no meaning in any other dimension
second the other two roots are pair of complex conjugates whose product is the constant term of the quadratic and whose sum is cos the negated linear term
this factorization is of interest for rotation matrices because the same thing occurs for all of them
as special cases for null rotation the complex conjugates are both and for rotation they are both
furthermore similar factorization holds for any rotation matrix
if the dimension is odd there will be dangling eigenvalue of and for any dimension the rest of the polynomial factors into quadratic terms like the one here with the two special cases noted
we are guaranteed that the characteristic polynomial will have degree and thus eigenvalues
and since rotation matrix commutes with its transpose it is normal matrix so can be diagonalized
we conclude that every rotation matrix when expressed in suitable coordinate system partitions into independent rotations of two dimensional subspaces at most of them
the sum of the entries on the main diagonal of matrix is called the trace it does not change if we reorient the coordinate system and always equals the sum of the eigenvalues
this has the convenient implication for and rotation matrices that the trace reveals the angle of rotation in the two dimensional space or subspace
for matrix the trace is cos and for matrix it is cos in the three dimensional case the subspace consists of all vectors perpendicular to the rotation axis the invariant direction with eigenvalue
thus we can extract from any rotation matrix rotation axis and an angle and these completely determine the rotation
sequential angles the constraints on rotation matrix imply that it must have the form with therefore we may set cos and sin for some angle to solve for it is not enough to look at alone or alone we must consider both together to place the angle in the correct quadrant using two argument arctangent function
now consider the first column of rotation matrix
although will probably not equal but some value we can use slight variation of the previous computation to find so called givens rotation that transforms the column to zeroing this acts on the subspace spanned by the and axes
we can then repeat the process for the xz subspace to zero acting on the full matrix these two rotations produce the schematic form
shifting attention to the second column givens rotation of the yz subspace can now zero the value
this brings the full matrix to the form which is an identity matrix
thus we have decomposed as an rotation matrix will have or entries below the diagonal to zero
we can zero them by extending the same idea of stepping through the columns with series of rotations in fixed sequence of planes
we conclude that the set of rotation matrices each of which has entries can be parameterized by angles
in three dimensions this restates in matrix form an observation made by euler so mathematicians call the ordered sequence of three angles euler angles
however the situation is somewhat more complicated than we have so far indicated
despite the small dimension we actually have considerable freedom in the sequence of axis pairs we use and we also have some freedom in the choice of angles
thus we find many different conventions employed when three dimensional rotations are parameterized for physics or medicine or chemistry or other disciplines
when we include the option of world axes or body axes different sequences are possible
and while some disciplines call any sequence euler angles others give different names cardano tait bryan roll pitch yaw to different sequences
one reason for the large number of options is that as noted previously rotations in three dimensions and higher do not commute
if we reverse given sequence of rotations we get different outcome
this also implies that we cannot compose two rotations by adding their corresponding angles
thus euler angles are not vectors despite similarity in appearance as triplet of numbers
nested dimensions rotation matrix such as cos sin sin cos suggests rotation matrix cos sin sin cos is embedded in the upper left corner
this is no illusion not just one but many copies of dimensional rotations are found within dimensional rotations as subgroups
each embedding leaves one direction fixed which in the case of matrices is the rotation axis
for example we have cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos cos sin sin cos fixing the axis the axis and the axis respectively
the rotation axis need not be coordinate axis if is unit vector in the desired direction then sin cos where cos sin is rotation by angle leaving axis fixed
direction in dimensional space will be unit magnitude vector which we may consider point on generalized sphere sn
thus it is natural to describe the rotation group so as combining so and sn
suitable formalism is the fiber bundle where for every direction in the base space sn the fiber over it in the total space so is copy of the fiber space so namely the rotations that keep that direction fixed
thus we can build an rotation matrix by starting with matrix aiming its fixed axis on the ordinary sphere in three dimensional space aiming the resulting rotation on and so on up through sn
point on sn can be selected using numbers so we again have numbers to describe any rotation matrix
in fact we can view the sequential angle decomposition discussed previously as reversing this process
the composition of givens rotations brings the first column and row to so that the remainder of the matrix is rotation matrix of dimension one less embedded so as to leave fixed
skew parameters via cayley formula when an rotation matrix does not include eigenvalue thus none of the planar rotations which it comprises are rotations then is an invertible matrix
most rotation matrices fit this description and for them it can be shown that is skew symmetric matrix thus at and since the diagonal is necessarily zero and since the upper triangle determines the lower one contains independent numbers
conveniently is invertible whenever is skew symmetric thus we can recover the original matrix using the cayley transform which maps any skew symmetric matrix to rotation matrix
in fact aside from the noted exceptions we can produce any rotation matrix in this way
although in practical applications we can hardly afford to ignore rotations the cayley transform is still potentially useful tool giving parameterization of most rotation matrices without trigonometric functions
in three dimensions for example we have cayley
if we condense the skew entries into vector then we produce rotation around the axis for around the axis for and around the axis for
the rotations are just out of reach for in the limit as does approach rotation around the axis and similarly for other directions
decomposition into shears for the case rotation matrix can be decomposed into three shear matrices paeth tan sin tan this is useful for instance in computer graphics since shears can be implemented with fewer multiplication instructions than rotating bitmap directly
on modern computers this may not matter but it can be relevant for very old or low end microprocessors
rotation can also be written as two shears and scaling daubechies sweldens tan sin cos cos cos group theory below follow some basic facts about the role of the collection of all rotation matrices of fixed dimension here mostly in mathematics and particularly in physics where rotational symmetry is requirement of every truly fundamental law due to the assumption of isotropy of space and where the same symmetry when present is simplifying property of many problems of less fundamental nature
examples abound in classical mechanics and quantum mechanics
knowledge of the part of the solutions pertaining to this symmetry applies with qualifications to all such problems and it can be factored out of specific problem at hand thus reducing its complexity
prime example in mathematics and physics would be the theory of spherical harmonics
their role in the group theory of the rotation groups is that of being representation space for the entire set of finite dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation group so
for this topic see rotation group so spherical harmonics
the main articles listed in each subsection are referred to for more detail
lie group the rotation matrices for each form group the special orthogonal group so
this algebraic structure is coupled with topological structure inherited from gl in such way that the operations of multiplication and taking the inverse are analytic functions of the matrix entries
thus so is for each lie group
it is compact and connected but not simply connected
it is also semi simple group in fact simple group with the exception so
the relevance of this is that all theorems and all machinery from the theory of analytic manifolds analytic manifolds are in particular smooth manifolds apply and the well developed representation theory of compact semi simple groups is ready for use
lie algebra the lie algebra so of so is given by and is the space of skew symmetric matrices of dimension see classical group where is the lie algebra of the orthogonal group
for reference the most common basis for so is
exponential map connecting the lie algebra to the lie group is the exponential map which is defined using the standard matrix exponential series for ea for any skew symmetric matrix exp is always rotation matrix an important practical example is the case
in rotation group so it is shown that one can identify every so with an euler vector where is unit magnitude vector
by the properties of the identification is in the null space of thus is left invariant by exp and is hence rotation axis
according to rodrigues rotation formula on matrix form one obtains exp exp exp sin cos where
this is the matrix for rotation around axis by the angle for full detail see exponential map so
baker campbell hausdorff formula the bch formula provides an explicit expression for log exey in terms of series expansion of nested commutators of and this general expansion unfolds as
in the case the general infinite expansion has compact form for suitable trigonometric function coefficients detailed in the baker campbell hausdorff formula for so
as group identity the above holds for all faithful representations including the doublet spinor representation which is simpler
the same explicit formula thus follows straightforwardly through pauli matrices see the derivation for su
for the general case one might use ref
spin group the lie group of rotation matrices so is not simply connected so lie theory tells us it is homomorphic image of universal covering group
often the covering group which in this case is called the spin group denoted by spin is simpler and more natural to work with in the case of planar rotations so is topologically circle
its universal covering group spin is isomorphic to the real line under addition
whenever angles of arbitrary magnitude are used one is taking advantage of the convenience of the universal cover
every rotation matrix is produced by countable infinity of angles separated by integer multiples of
correspondingly the fundamental group of so is isomorphic to the integers in the case of spatial rotations so is topologically equivalent to three dimensional real projective space rp
its universal covering group spin is isomorphic to the sphere
every rotation matrix is produced by two opposite points on the sphere
correspondingly the fundamental group of so is isomorphic to the two element group
we can also describe spin as isomorphic to quaternions of unit norm under multiplication or to certain real matrices or to complex special unitary matrices namely su
the covering maps for the first and the last case are given by and
for detailed account of the su covering and the quaternionic covering see spin group so
many features of these cases are the same for higher dimensions
the coverings are all two to one with so having fundamental group
the natural setting for these groups is within clifford algebra
one type of action of the rotations is produced by kind of sandwich denoted by qvq
more importantly in applications to physics the corresponding spin representation of the lie algebra sits inside the clifford algebra
it can be exponentiated in the usual way to give rise to valued representation also known as projective representation of the rotation group
this is the case with so and su where the valued representation can be viewed as an inverse of the covering map
by properties of covering maps the inverse can be chosen ono to one as local section but not globally
infinitesimal rotations the matrices in the lie algebra are not themselves rotations the skew symmetric matrices are derivatives proportional differences of rotations
an actual differential rotation or infinitesimal rotation matrix has the form where is vanishingly small and so for instance with lx
the computation rules are as usual except that infinitesimals of second order are routinely dropped
with these rules these matrices do not satisfy all the same properties as ordinary finite rotation matrices under the usual treatment of infinitesimals
it turns out that the order in which infinitesimal rotations are applied is irrelevant
to see this exemplified consult infinitesimal rotations so
conversions we have seen the existence of several decompositions that apply in any dimension namely independent planes sequential angles and nested dimensions
in all these cases we can either decompose matrix or construct one
we have also given special attention to rotation matrices and these warrant further attention in both directions stuelpnagel
quaternion given the unit quaternion xi yj zk the equivalent pre multiplied to be used with column vectors rotation matrix is
now every quaternion component appears multiplied by two in term of degree two and if all such terms are zero what is left is an identity matrix
this leads to an efficient robust conversion from any quaternion whether unit or non unit to rotation matrix
given if otherwise we can calculate freed from the demand for unit quaternion we find that nonzero quaternions act as homogeneous coordinates for rotation matrices
the cayley transform discussed earlier is obtained by scaling the quaternion so that its component is for rotation around any axis will be zero which explains the cayley limitation
the sum of the entries along the main diagonal the trace plus one equals which is
thus we can write the trace itself as and from the previous version of the matrix we see that the diagonal entries themselves have the same form and so we can easily compare the magnitudes of all four quaternion components using the matrix diagonal
we can in fact obtain all four magnitudes using sums and square roots and choose consistent signs using the skew symmetric part of the off diagonal entries tr the trace of sgn sgn sgn alternatively use single square root and division tr this is numerically stable so long as the trace is not negative otherwise we risk dividing by nearly zero
in that case suppose qxx is the largest diagonal entry so will have the largest magnitude the other cases are derived by cyclic permutation then the following is safe
if the matrix contains significant error such as accumulated numerical error we may construct symmetric matrix and find the eigenvector of its largest magnitude eigenvalue
if is truly rotation matrix that value will be
the quaternion so obtained will correspond to the rotation matrix closest to the given matrix bar itzhack note formulation of the cited article is post multiplied works with row vectors
polar decomposition if the matrix is nonsingular its columns are linearly independent vectors thus the gram schmidt process can adjust them to be an orthonormal basis
stated in terms of numerical linear algebra we convert to an orthogonal matrix using qr decomposition
however we often prefer closest to which this method does not accomplish
for that the tool we want is the polar decomposition fan hoffman higham
to measure closeness we may use any matrix norm invariant under orthogonal transformations
convenient choice is the frobenius norm squared which is the sum of the squares of the element differences
writing this in terms of the trace tr our goal is find minimizing tr subject to qtq though written in matrix terms the objective function is just quadratic polynomial
we can minimize it in the usual way by finding where its derivative is zero
for matrix the orthogonality constraint implies six scalar equalities that the entries of must satisfy
to incorporate the constraint we may employ standard technique lagrange multipliers assembled as symmetric matrix thus our method is differentiate tr qtq with respect to the entries of and equate to zero
in general we obtain the equation so that where is orthogonal and is symmetric
to ensure minimum the matrix and hence must be positive definite
linear algebra calls qs the polar decomposition of with the positive square root of mtm
when is non singular the and factors of the polar decomposition are uniquely determined
however the determinant of is positive because is positive definite so inherits the sign of the determinant of that is is only guaranteed to be orthogonal not rotation matrix
this is unavoidable an with negative determinant has no uniquely defined closest rotation matrix
axis and angle to efficiently construct rotation matrix from an angle and unit axis we can take advantage of symmetry and skew symmetry within the entries
if and are the components of the unit vector representing the axis and cos sin then determining an axis and angle like determining quaternion is only possible up to the sign that is and correspond to the same rotation matrix just like and
additionally axis angle extraction presents additional difficulties
the angle can be restricted to be from to but angles are formally ambiguous by multiples of
when the angle is zero the axis is undefined
when the angle is the matrix becomes symmetric which has implications in extracting the axis
near multiples of care is needed to avoid numerical problems in extracting the angle two argument arctangent with atan sin cos equal to avoids the insensitivity of arccos and in computing the axis magnitude in order to force unit magnitude brute force approach can lose accuracy through underflow moler morrison
partial approach is as follows atan the and components of the axis would then be divided by fully robust approach will use different algorithm when the trace of the matrix is negative as with quaternion extraction
when is zero because the angle is zero an axis must be provided from some source other than the matrix
euler angles complexity of conversion escalates with euler angles used here in the broad sense
the first difficulty is to establish which of the twenty four variations of cartesian axis order we will use
suppose the three angles are physics and chemistry may interpret these as while aircraft dynamics may use
one systematic approach begins with choosing the rightmost axis
among all permutations of only two place that axis first one is an even permutation and the other odd
choosing parity thus establishes the middle axis
that leaves two choices for the left most axis either duplicating the first or not
these three choices gives us variations we double that to by choosing static or rotating axes
this is enough to construct matrix from angles but triples differing in many ways can give the same rotation matrix
for example suppose we use the zyz convention above then we have the following equivalent pairs angles for any order can be found using concise common routine herter lott shoemake
the problem of singular alignment the mathematical analog of physical gimbal lock occurs when the middle rotation aligns the axes of the first and last rotations
it afflicts every axis order at either even or odd multiples of
these singularities are not characteristic of the rotation matrix as such and only occur with the usage of euler angles
the singularities are avoided when considering and manipulating the rotation matrix as orthonormal row vectors in applications often named the right vector up vector and out vector instead of as angles
the singularities are also avoided when working with quaternions
vector to vector formulation in some instances it is interesting to describe rotation by specifying how vector is mapped into another through the shortest path smallest angle
in this completely describes the associated rotation matrix
in general given the matrix belongs to so and maps to
uniform random rotation matrices we sometimes need to generate uniformly distributed random rotation matrix
it seems intuitively clear in two dimensions that this means the rotation angle is uniformly distributed between and
that intuition is correct but does not carry over to higher dimensions
for example if we decompose rotation matrices in axis angle form the angle should not be uniformly distributed the probability that the magnitude of the angle is at most should be sin for since so is connected and locally compact lie group we have simple standard criterion for uniformity namely that the distribution be unchanged when composed with any arbitrary rotation lie group translation
this definition corresponds to what is called haar measure
le mass rivest show how to use the cayley transform to generate and test matrices according to this criterion
we can also generate uniform distribution in any dimension using the subgroup algorithm of diaconis shashahani
this recursively exploits the nested dimensions group structure of so as follows
generate uniform angle and construct rotation matrix
to step from to generate vector uniformly distributed on the sphere sn embed the matrix in the next larger size with last column and rotate the larger matrix so the last column becomes as usual we have special alternatives for the case
each of these methods begins with three independent random scalars uniformly distributed on the unit interval
arvo takes advantage of the odd dimension to change householder reflection to rotation by negation and uses that to aim the axis of uniform planar rotation
another method uses unit quaternions
multiplication of rotation matrices is homomorphic to multiplication of quaternions and multiplication by unit quaternion rotates the unit sphere
since the homomorphism is local isometry we immediately conclude that to produce uniform distribution on so we may use uniform distribution on
in practice create four element vector where each element is sampling of normal distribution
normalize its length and you have uniformly sampled random unit quaternion which represents uniformly sampled random rotation
note that the aforementioned only applies to rotations in dimension for generalised idea of quaternions one should look into rotors
euler angles can also be used though not with each angle uniformly distributed murnaghan miles
for the axis angle form the axis is uniformly distributed over the unit sphere of directions while the angle has the nonuniform distribution over noted previously miles

linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as linear maps such as and their representations in vector spaces and through matrices linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics
for instance linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry including for defining basic objects such as lines planes and rotations
also functional analysis branch of mathematical analysis may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions
linear algebra is also used in most sciences and fields of engineering because it allows modeling many natural phenomena and computing efficiently with such models
for nonlinear systems which cannot be modeled with linear algebra it is often used for dealing with first order approximations using the fact that the differential of multivariate function at point is the linear map that best approximates the function near that point
history the procedure using counting rods for solving simultaneous linear equations now called gaussian elimination appears in the ancient chinese mathematical text chapter eight rectangular arrays of the nine chapters on the mathematical art
its use is illustrated in eighteen problems with two to five equations systems of linear equations arose in europe with the introduction in by ren descartes of coordinates in geometry
in fact in this new geometry now called cartesian geometry lines and planes are represented by linear equations and computing their intersections amounts to solving systems of linear equations
the first systematic methods for solving linear systems used determinants and were first considered by leibniz in in gabriel cramer used them for giving explicit solutions of linear systems now called cramer rule
later gauss further described the method of elimination which was initially listed as an advancement in geodesy in hermann grassmann published his theory of extension which included foundational new topics of what is today called linear algebra
in james joseph sylvester introduced the term matrix which is latin for womb
linear algebra grew with ideas noted in the complex plane
for instance two numbers and in have difference and the line segments wz and are of the same length and direction
the segments are equipollent
the four dimensional system of quaternions was started in the term vector was introduced as xi yj zk representing point in space
the quaternion difference also produces segment equipollent to pq
other hypercomplex number systems also used the idea of linear space with basis
arthur cayley introduced matrix multiplication and the inverse matrix in making possible the general linear group
the mechanism of group representation became available for describing complex and hypercomplex numbers
crucially cayley used single letter to denote matrix thus treating matrix as an aggregate object
he also realized the connection between matrices and determinants and wrote there would be many things to say about this theory of matrices which should it seems to me precede the theory of determinants benjamin peirce published his linear associative algebra and his son charles sanders peirce extended the work later the telegraph required an explanatory system and the publication of treatise on electricity and magnetism instituted field theory of forces and required differential geometry for expression
linear algebra is flat differential geometry and serves in tangent spaces to manifolds
electromagnetic symmetries of spacetime are expressed by the lorentz transformations and much of the history of linear algebra is the history of lorentz transformations
the first modern and more precise definition of vector space was introduced by peano in by theory of linear transformations of finite dimensional vector spaces had emerged
linear algebra took its modern form in the first half of the twentieth century when many ideas and methods of previous centuries were generalized as abstract algebra
the development of computers led to increased research in efficient algorithms for gaussian elimination and matrix decompositions and linear algebra became an essential tool for modelling and simulations
vector spaces until the th century linear algebra was introduced through systems of linear equations and matrices
in modern mathematics the presentation through vector spaces is generally preferred since it is more synthetic more general not limited to the finite dimensional case and conceptually simpler although more abstract
vector space over field often the field of the real numbers is set equipped with two binary operations satisfying the following axioms
elements of are called vectors and elements of are called scalars
the first operation vector addition takes any two vectors and and outputs third vector the second operation scalar multiplication takes any scalar and any vector and outputs new vector av
the axioms that addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy are the following
in the list below and are arbitrary elements of and and are arbitrary scalars in the field the first four axioms mean that is an abelian group under addition
an element of specific vector space may have various nature for example it could be sequence function polynomial or matrix
linear algebra is concerned with those properties of such objects that are common to all vector spaces
linear maps linear maps are mappings between vector spaces that preserve the vector space structure
given two vector spaces and over field linear map also called in some contexts linear transformation or linear mapping is map that is compatible with addition and scalar multiplication that is for any vectors in and scalar in this implies that for any vectors in and scalars in one has when are the same vector space linear map is also known as linear operator on bijective linear map between two vector spaces that is every vector from the second space is associated with exactly one in the first is an isomorphism
because an isomorphism preserves linear structure two isomorphic vector spaces are essentially the same from the linear algebra point of view in the sense that they cannot be distinguished by using vector space properties
an essential question in linear algebra is testing whether linear map is an isomorphism or not and if it is not an isomorphism finding its range or image and the set of elements that are mapped to the zero vector called the kernel of the map
all these questions can be solved by using gaussian elimination or some variant of this algorithm
subspaces span and basis the study of those subsets of vector spaces that are in themselves vector spaces under the induced operations is fundamental similarly as for many mathematical structures
these subsets are called linear subspaces
more precisely linear subspace of vector space over field is subset of such that and au are in for every in and every in these conditions suffice for implying that is vector space
for example given linear map the image of and the inverse image of called kernel or null space are linear subspaces of and respectively
another important way of forming subspace is to consider linear combinations of set of vectors the set of all sums where vk are in and ak are in form linear subspace called the span of the span of is also the intersection of all linear subspaces containing in other words it is the smallest for the inclusion relation linear subspace containing set of vectors is linearly independent if none is in the span of the others
equivalently set of vectors is linearly independent if the only way to express the zero vector as linear combination of elements of is to take zero for every coefficient ai
set of vectors that spans vector space is called spanning set or generating set
if spanning set is linearly dependent that is not linearly independent then some element of is in the span of the other elements of and the span would remain the same if one remove from one may continue to remove elements of until getting linearly independent spanning set
such linearly independent set that spans vector space is called basis of the importance of bases lies in the fact that they are simultaneously minimal generating sets and maximal independent sets
more precisely if is linearly independent set and is spanning set such that then there is basis such that any two bases of vector space have the same cardinality which is called the dimension of this is the dimension theorem for vector spaces
moreover two vector spaces over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension if any basis of and therefore every basis has finite number of elements is finite dimensional vector space
if is subspace of then dim dim in the case where is finite dimensional the equality of the dimensions implies if and are subspaces of then dim dim dim dim where denotes the span of
matrices matrices allow explicit manipulation of finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps
their theory is thus an essential part of linear algebra
let be finite dimensional vector space over field and vm be basis of thus is the dimension of
by definition of basis the map is bijection from fm the set of the sequences of elements of onto this is an isomorphism of vector spaces if fm is equipped of its standard structure of vector space where vector addition and scalar multiplication are done component by component
this isomorphism allows representing vector by its inverse image under this isomorphism that is by the coordinate vector am or by the column matrix
if is another finite dimensional vector space possibly the same with basis wn linear map from to is well defined by its values on the basis elements that is wn
thus is well represented by the list of the corresponding column matrices
that is if for then is represented by the matrix with rows and columns
matrix multiplication is defined in such way that the product of two matrices is the matrix of the composition of the corresponding linear maps and the product of matrix and column matrix is the column matrix representing the result of applying the represented linear map to the represented vector
it follows that the theory of finite dimensional vector spaces and the theory of matrices are two different languages for expressing exactly the same concepts
two matrices that encode the same linear transformation in different bases are called similar
it can be proved that two matrices are similar if and only if one can transform one into the other by elementary row and column operations
for matrix representing linear map from to the row operations correspond to change of bases in and the column operations correspond to change of bases in every matrix is similar to an identity matrix possibly bordered by zero rows and zero columns
in terms of vector spaces this means that for any linear map from to there are bases such that part of the basis of is mapped bijectively on part of the basis of and that the remaining basis elements of if any are mapped to zero
gaussian elimination is the basic algorithm for finding these elementary operations and proving these results
linear systems finite set of linear equations in finite set of variables for example xn or is called system of linear equations or linear system systems of linear equations form fundamental part of linear algebra
historically linear algebra and matrix theory has been developed for solving such systems
in the modern presentation of linear algebra through vector spaces and matrices many problems may be interpreted in terms of linear systems
for example let be linear system
to such system one may associate its matrix
and its right member vector
let be the linear transformation associated to the matrix solution of the system is vector such that that is an element of the preimage of by let be the associated homogeneous system where the right hand sides of the equations are put to zero the solutions of are exactly the elements of the kernel of or equivalently the gaussian elimination consists of performing elementary row operations on the augmented matrix for putting it in reduced row echelon form
these row operations do not change the set of solutions of the system of equations
in the example the reduced echelon form is showing that the system has the unique solution it follows from this matrix interpretation of linear systems that the same methods can be applied for solving linear systems and for many operations on matrices and linear transformations which include the computation of the ranks kernels matrix inverses
endomorphisms and square matrices linear endomorphism is linear map that maps vector space to itself
if has basis of elements such an endomorphism is represented by square matrix of size with respect to general linear maps linear endomorphisms and square matrices have some specific properties that make their study an important part of linear algebra which is used in many parts of mathematics including geometric transformations coordinate changes quadratic forms and many other part of mathematics
determinant the determinant of square matrix is defined to be where sn is the group of all permutations of elements is permutation and the parity of the permutation
matrix is invertible if and only if the determinant is invertible nonzero if the scalars belong to field
cramer rule is closed form expression in terms of determinants of the solution of system of linear equations in unknowns
cramer rule is useful for reasoning about the solution but except for or it is rarely used for computing solution since gaussian elimination is faster algorithm
the determinant of an endomorphism is the determinant of the matrix representing the endomorphism in terms of some ordered basis
this definition makes sense since this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis
eigenvalues and eigenvectors if is linear endomorphism of vector space over field an eigenvector of is nonzero vector of such that av for some scalar in this scalar is an eigenvalue of if the dimension of is finite and basis has been chosen and may be represented respectively by square matrix and column matrix the equation defining eigenvectors and eigenvalues becomes using the identity matrix whose entries are all zero except those of the main diagonal which are equal to one this may be rewritten as is supposed to be nonzero this means that ai is singular matrix and thus that its determinant det ai equals zero
the eigenvalues are thus the roots of the polynomial det
if is of dimension this is monic polynomial of degree called the characteristic polynomial of the matrix or of the endomorphism and there are at most eigenvalues
if basis exists that consists only of eigenvectors the matrix of on this basis has very simple structure it is diagonal matrix such that the entries on the main diagonal are eigenvalues and the other entries are zero
in this case the endomorphism and the matrix are said to be diagonalizable
more generally an endomorphism and matrix are also said diagonalizable if they become diagonalizable after extending the field of scalars
in this extended sense if the characteristic polynomial is square free then the matrix is diagonalizable
symmetric matrix is always diagonalizable
there are non diagonalizable matrices the simplest being it cannot be diagonalizable since its square is the zero matrix and the square of nonzero diagonal matrix is never zero
when an endomorphism is not diagonalizable there are bases on which it has simple form although not as simple as the diagonal form
the frobenius normal form does not need of extending the field of scalars and makes the characteristic polynomial immediately readable on the matrix
the jordan normal form requires to extend the field of scalar for containing all eigenvalues and differs from the diagonal form only by some entries that are just above the main diagonal and are equal to
duality linear form is linear map from vector space over field to the field of scalars viewed as vector space over itself
equipped by pointwise addition and multiplication by scalar the linear forms form vector space called the dual space of and usually denoted or if vn is basis of this implies that is finite dimensional then one can define for linear map vi such that vi vi and vi vj if these linear maps form basis of called the dual basis of vn
if is not finite dimensional the vi may be defined similarly they are linearly independent but do not form basis
for in the map is linear form on
this defines the canonical linear map from into the dual of called the bidual of this canonical map is an isomorphism if is finite dimensional and this allows identifying with its bidual
in the infinite dimensional case the canonical map is injective but not surjective
there is thus complete symmetry between finite dimensional vector space and its dual
this motivates the frequent use in this context of the bra ket notation for denoting
dual map let be linear map
for every linear form on the composite function is linear form on this defines linear map between the dual spaces which is called the dual or the transpose of if and are finite dimensional and is the matrix of in terms of some ordered bases then the matrix of over the dual bases is the transpose mt of obtained by exchanging rows and columns
if elements of vector spaces and their duals are represented by column vectors this duality may be expressed in bra ket notation by
for highlighting this symmetry the two members of this equality are sometimes written
inner product spaces besides these basic concepts linear algebra also studies vector spaces with additional structure such as an inner product
the inner product is an example of bilinear form and it gives the vector space geometric structure by allowing for the definition of length and angles
formally an inner product is map that satisfies the following three axioms for all vectors in and all scalars in conjugate symmetry
in it is symmetric linearity in the first argument
positive definiteness with equality only for we can define the length of vector in by and we can prove the cauchy schwarz inequality
in particular the quantity and so we can call this quantity the cosine of the angle between the two vectors
two vectors are orthogonal if an orthonormal basis is basis where all basis vectors have length and are orthogonal to each other
given any finite dimensional vector space an orthonormal basis could be found by the gram schmidt procedure
orthonormal bases are particularly easy to deal with since if an vn then
the inner product facilitates the construction of many useful concepts
for instance given transform we can define its hermitian conjugate as the linear transform satisfying
if satisfies tt we call normal
it turns out that normal matrices are precisely the matrices that have an orthonormal system of eigenvectors that span relationship with geometry there is strong relationship between linear algebra and geometry which started with the introduction by ren descartes in of cartesian coordinates
in this new at that time geometry now called cartesian geometry points are represented by cartesian coordinates which are sequences of three real numbers in the case of the usual three dimensional space
the basic objects of geometry which are lines and planes are represented by linear equations
thus computing intersections of lines and planes amounts to solving systems of linear equations
this was one of the main motivations for developing linear algebra
most geometric transformation such as translations rotations reflections rigid motions isometries and projections transform lines into lines
it follows that they can be defined specified and studied in terms of linear maps
this is also the case of homographies and bius transformations when considered as transformations of projective space
until the end of the th century geometric spaces were defined by axioms relating points lines and planes synthetic geometry
around this date it appeared that one may also define geometric spaces by constructions involving vector spaces see for example projective space and affine space
it has been shown that the two approaches are essentially equivalent
in classical geometry the involved vector spaces are vector spaces over the reals but the constructions may be extended to vector spaces over any field allowing considering geometry over arbitrary fields including finite fields
presently most textbooks introduce geometric spaces from linear algebra and geometry is often presented at elementary level as subfield of linear algebra
usage and applications linear algebra is used in almost all areas of mathematics thus making it relevant in almost all scientific domains that use mathematics
these applications may be divided into several wide categories
geometry of ambient space the modeling of ambient space is based on geometry
sciences concerned with this space use geometry widely
this is the case with mechanics and robotics for describing rigid body dynamics geodesy for describing earth shape perspectivity computer vision and computer graphics for describing the relationship between scene and its plane representation and many other scientific domains
in all these applications synthetic geometry is often used for general descriptions and qualitative approach but for the study of explicit situations one must compute with coordinates
this requires the heavy use of linear algebra
functional analysis functional analysis studies function spaces
these are vector spaces with additional structure such as hilbert spaces
linear algebra is thus fundamental part of functional analysis and its applications which include in particular quantum mechanics wave functions
study of complex systems most physical phenomena are modeled by partial differential equations
to solve them one usually decomposes the space in which the solutions are searched into small mutually interacting cells
for linear systems this interaction involves linear functions
for nonlinear systems this interaction is often approximated by linear functions this is called linear model or first order approximation
linear models are frequently used for complex nonlinear real world systems because it makes parametrization more manageable
in both cases very large matrices are generally involved
weather forecasting or more specifically parametrization for atmospheric modeling is typical example of real world application where the whole earth atmosphere is divided into cells of say km of width and km of height
scientific computation nearly all scientific computations involve linear algebra
consequently linear algebra algorithms have been highly optimized
blas and lapack are the best known implementations
for improving efficiency some of them configure the algorithms automatically at run time for adapting them to the specificities of the computer cache size number of available cores
some processors typically graphics processing units gpu are designed with matrix structure for optimizing the operations of linear algebra
extensions and generalizations this section presents several related topics that do not appear generally in elementary textbooks on linear algebra but are commonly considered in advanced mathematics as parts of linear algebra
module theory the existence of multiplicative inverses in fields is not involved in the axioms defining vector space
one may thus replace the field of scalars by ring and this gives structure called module over or module
the concepts of linear independence span basis and linear maps also called module homomorphisms are defined for modules exactly as for vector spaces with the essential difference that if is not field there are modules that do not have any basis
the modules that have basis are the free modules and those that are spanned by finite set are the finitely generated modules
module homomorphisms between finitely generated free modules may be represented by matrices
the theory of matrices over ring is similar to that of matrices over field except that determinants exist only if the ring is commutative and that square matrix over commutative ring is invertible only if its determinant has multiplicative inverse in the ring
vector spaces are completely characterized by their dimension up to an isomorphism
in general there is not such complete classification for modules even if one restricts oneself to finitely generated modules
however every module is cokernel of homomorphism of free modules
modules over the integers can be identified with abelian groups since the multiplication by an integer may identified to repeated addition
most of the theory of abelian groups may be extended to modules over principal ideal domain
in particular over principal ideal domain every submodule of free module is free and the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups may be extended straightforwardly to finitely generated modules over principal ring
there are many rings for which there are algorithms for solving linear equations and systems of linear equations
however these algorithms have generally computational complexity that is much higher than the similar algorithms over field
for more details see linear equation over ring
multilinear algebra and tensors in multilinear algebra one considers multivariable linear transformations that is mappings that are linear in each of number of different variables
this line of inquiry naturally leads to the idea of the dual space the vector space consisting of linear maps where is the field of scalars
multilinear maps vn can be described via tensor products of elements of
if in addition to vector addition and scalar multiplication there is bilinear vector product the vector space is called an algebra for instance associative algebras are algebras with an associate vector product like the algebra of square matrices or the algebra of polynomials
topological vector spaces vector spaces that are not finite dimensional often require additional structure to be tractable
normed vector space is vector space along with function called norm which measures the size of elements
the norm induces metric which measures the distance between elements and induces topology which allows for definition of continuous maps
the metric also allows for definition of limits and completeness metric space that is complete is known as banach space
complete metric space along with the additional structure of an inner product conjugate symmetric sesquilinear form is known as hilbert space which is in some sense particularly well behaved banach space
functional analysis applies the methods of linear algebra alongside those of mathematical analysis to study various function spaces the central objects of study in functional analysis are lp spaces which are banach spaces and especially the space of square integrable functions which is the only hilbert space among them
functional analysis is of particular importance to quantum mechanics the theory of partial differential equations digital signal processing and electrical engineering
it also provides the foundation and theoretical framework that underlies the fourier transform and related methods

in mathematics matrix norm is vector norm in vector space whose elements vectors are matrices of given dimensions
preliminaries given field of either real or complex numbers let be the vector space of matrices with rows and columns and entries in the field matrix norm is norm on this article will always write such norms with double vertical bars like so
thus the matrix norm is function that must satisfy the following properties for all scalars and matrices positive valued definite absolutely homogeneous sub additive or satisfying the triangle inequality the only feature distinguishing matrices from rearranged vectors is multiplication
matrix norms are particularly useful if they are also sub multiplicative every norm on kn can be rescaled to be sub multiplicative in some books the terminology matrix norm is reserved for sub multiplicative norms
matrix norms induced by vector norms suppose vector norm on and vector norm on are given
any matrix induces linear operator from to with respect to the standard basis and one defines the corresponding induced norm or operator norm or subordinate norm on the space of all matrices as follows where sup denotes the supremum
this norm measures how much the mapping induced by can stretch vectors
depending on the vector norms used notation other than can be used for the operator norm
matrix norms induced by vector norms if the norm for vectors is used for both spaces and then the corresponding operator norm is these induced norms are different from the entry wise norms and the schatten norms for matrices treated below which are also usually denoted by in the special cases of the induced matrix norms can be computed or estimated by which is simply the maximum absolute column sum of the matrix which is simply the maximum absolute row sum of the matrix
in the special case of the euclidean norm or norm for vectors the induced matrix norm is the spectral norm
the two values do not coincide in infinite dimensions see spectral radius for further discussion
the spectral norm of matrix is the largest singular value of the square root of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix where denotes the conjugate transpose of where max represents the largest singular value of matrix also since max max and similarly by singular value decomposition svd
there is another important inequality where is the frobenius norm
equality holds if and only if the matrix is rank one matrix or zero matrix
this inequality can be derived from the fact that the trace of matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues
when we have an equivalent definition for as sup with
it can be shown to be equivalent to the above definitions using the cauchy schwarz inequality
for example for we have that properties any operator norm is consistent with the vector norms that induce it giving suppose and are operator norms induced by the respective pairs of vector norms and
then this follows from and square matrices suppose is an operator norm on the space of square matrices induced by vector norms and then the operator norm is sub multiplicative matrix norm moreover any such norm satisfies the inequality for all positive integers where is the spectral radius of for symmetric or hermitian we have equality in for the norm since in this case the norm is precisely the spectral radius of for an arbitrary matrix we may not have equality for any norm counterexample would be which has vanishing spectral radius
in any case for any matrix norm we have the spectral radius formula consistent and compatible norms matrix norm on is called consistent with vector norm on and vector norm on if for all and all in the special case of and is also called compatible with all induced norms are consistent by definition
also any sub multiplicative matrix norm on induces compatible vector norm on by defining
entry wise matrix norms these norms treat an matrix as vector of size and use one of the familiar vector norms
for example using the norm for vectors we get this is different norm from the induced norm see above and the schatten norm see below but the notation is the same
the special case is the frobenius norm and yields the maximum norm
and lp norms let be the columns of matrix from the original definition the matrix presents data points in dimensional space
the norm is the sum of the euclidean norms of the columns of the matrix the norm as an error function is more robust since the error for each data point column is not squared
it is used in robust data analysis and sparse coding
for the norm can be generalized to the norm as follows
frobenius norm when for the norm it is called the frobenius norm or the hilbert schmidt norm though the latter term is used more frequently in the context of operators on possibly infinite dimensional hilbert space
this norm can be defined in various ways trace min where are the singular values of recall that the trace function returns the sum of diagonal entries of square matrix
the frobenius norm is an extension of the euclidean norm to and comes from the frobenius inner product on the space of all matrices
the frobenius norm is sub multiplicative and is very useful for numerical linear algebra
the sub multiplicativity of frobenius norm can be proved using cauchy schwarz inequality
frobenius norm is often easier to compute than induced norms and has the useful property of being invariant under rotations and unitary operations in general
that is for any unitary matrix this property follows from the cyclic nature of the trace trace trace trace trace trace trace and analogously trace trace trace where we have used the unitary nature of that is
it also satisfies and where is the frobenius inner product and re is the real part of complex number irrelevant for real matrices max norm the max norm is the elementwise norm in the limit as goes to infinity max max
this norm is not sub multiplicative
note that in some literature such as communication complexity an alternative definition of max norm also called the norm refers to the factorization norm min min max schatten norms the schatten norms arise when applying the norm to the vector of singular values of matrix
if the singular values of the matrix are denoted by then the schatten norm is defined by min these norms again share the notation with the induced and entry wise norms but they are different
all schatten norms are sub multiplicative
they are also unitarily invariant which means that for all matrices and all unitary matrices and the most familiar cases are
the case yields the frobenius norm introduced before
the case yields the spectral norm which is the operator norm induced by the vector norm see above
finally yields the nuclear norm also known as the trace norm or the ky fan norm defined as trace min where denotes positive semidefinite matrix such that more precisely since is positive semidefinite matrix its square root is well defined
the nuclear norm is convex envelope of the rank function rank so it is often used in mathematical optimization to search for low rank matrices
monotone norms matrix norm is called monotone if it is monotonic with respect to the loewner order
thus matrix norm is increasing if
the frobenius norm and spectral norm are examples of monotone norms
cut norms another source of inspiration for matrix norms arises from considering matrix as the adjacency matrix of weighted directed graph
the so called cut norm measures how close the associated graph is to being bipartite where km
equivalent definitions up to constant factor impose the conditions or the cut norm is equivalent to the induced operator norm which is itself equivalent to the another norm called the grothendieck norm to define the grothendieck norm first note that linear operator is just scalar and thus extends to linear operator on any kk kk
moreover given any choice of basis for kn and km any linear operator kn km extends to linear operator kk kk by letting each matrix element on elements of kk via scalar multiplication
the grothendieck norm is the norm of that extended operator in symbols the grothendieck norm depends on choice of basis usually taken to be the standard basis and equivalence of norms for any two matrix norms and we have that for some positive numbers and for all matrices in other words all norms on are equivalent they induce the same topology on this is true because the vector space has the finite dimension moreover for every vector norm on there exists unique positive real number such that is sub multiplicative matrix norm for every sub multiplicative matrix norm is said to be minimal if there exists no other sub multiplicative matrix norm satisfying
examples of norm equivalence let once again refer to the norm induced by the vector norm as above in the induced norm section
for matrix of rank the following inequalities hold max max another useful inequality between matrix norms is which is special case of lder inequality

principal component analysis pca is popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing high number of dimensions features per observation increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount of information and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data
formally pca is statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of dataset
this is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into new coordinate system where most of the variation in the data can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data
many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points
principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics microbiome studies and atmospheric science
the principal components of collection of points in real coordinate space are sequence of unit vectors where the th vector is the direction of line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first vectors
here best fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line
these directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated
principal component analysis pca is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform change of basis on the data sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest
in data analysis the first principal component of set of variables presumed to be jointly normally distributed is the derived variable formed as linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance
the second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed and we may proceed through iterations until all the variance is explained
pca is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set
pca is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models
it is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower dimensional data while preserving as much of the data variation as possible
the first principal component can equivalently be defined as direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data
the th principal component can be taken as direction orthogonal to the first principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data
for either objective it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix
thus the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix
pca is the simplest of the true eigenvector based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis
factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of slightly different matrix
pca is also related to canonical correlation analysis cca
cca defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross covariance between two datasets while pca defines new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in single dataset
robust and norm based variants of standard pca have also been proposed
history pca was invented in by karl pearson as an analogue of the principal axis theorem in mechanics it was later independently developed and named by harold hotelling in the
depending on the field of application it is also named the discrete karhunen lo ve transform klt in signal processing the hotelling transform in multivariate quality control proper orthogonal decomposition pod in mechanical engineering singular value decomposition svd of invented in the last quarter of the th century eigenvalue decomposition evd of xtx in linear algebra factor analysis for discussion of the differences between pca and factor analysis see ch
of jolliffe principal component analysis eckart young theorem harman or empirical orthogonal functions eof in meteorological science empirical eigenfunction decomposition sirovich empirical component analysis lorenz quasiharmonic modes brooks et al spectral decomposition in noise and vibration and empirical modal analysis in structural dynamics
intuition pca can be thought of as fitting dimensional ellipsoid to the data where each axis of the ellipsoid represents principal component
if some axis of the ellipsoid is small then the variance along that axis is also small
to find the axes of the ellipsoid we must first center the values of each variable in the dataset on by subtracting the mean of the variable observed values from each of those values
these transformed values are used instead of the original observed values for each of the variables
then we compute the covariance matrix of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix
then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to turn them into unit vectors
once this is done each of the mutually orthogonal unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data
this choice of basis will transform the covariance matrix into diagonalized form in which the diagonal elements represent the variance of each axis
the proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues
biplots and scree plots degree of explained variance are used to explain findings of the pca
details pca is defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate called the first principal component the second greatest variance on the second coordinate and so on consider an data matrix with column wise zero empirical mean the sample mean of each column has been shifted to zero where each of the rows represents different repetition of the experiment and each of the columns gives particular kind of feature say the results from particular sensor
mathematically the transformation is defined by set of size of dimensional vectors of weights or coefficients that map each row vector of to new vector of principal component scores given by in such way that the individual variables of considered over the data set successively inherit the maximum possible variance from with each coefficient vector constrained to be unit vector where is usually selected to be strictly less than to reduce dimensionality
first component in order to maximize variance the first weight vector thus has to satisfy arg max arg max equivalently writing this in matrix form gives arg max arg max since has been defined to be unit vector it equivalently also satisfies arg max the quantity to be maximised can be recognised as rayleigh quotient
standard result for positive semidefinite matrix such as xtx is that the quotient maximum possible value is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix which occurs when is the corresponding eigenvector
with found the first principal component of data vector can then be given as score in the transformed co ordinates or as the corresponding vector in the original variables
further components the th component can be found by subtracting the first principal components from and then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix arg max it turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of xtx with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues
thus the weight vectors are eigenvectors of xtx
the th principal component of data vector can therefore be given as score tk in the transformed coordinates or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables where is the kth eigenvector of xtx
the full principal components decomposition of can therefore be given as where is by matrix of weights whose columns are the eigenvectors of xtx
the transpose of is sometimes called the whitening or sphering transformation
columns of multiplied by the square root of corresponding eigenvalues that is eigenvectors scaled up by the variances are called loadings in pca or in factor analysis
covariances xtx itself can be recognized as proportional to the empirical sample covariance matrix of the dataset xt
the sample covariance between two of the different principal components over the dataset is given by where the eigenvalue property of has been used to move from line to line however eigenvectors and corresponding to eigenvalues of symmetric matrix are orthogonal if the eigenvalues are different or can be orthogonalised if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value
the product in the final line is therefore zero there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset
another way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix
in matrix form the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be written the empirical covariance matrix between the principal components becomes where is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of xtx
is equal to the sum of the squares over the dataset associated with each component that is tk
dimensionality reduction the transformation maps data vector from an original space of variables to new space of variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset
however not all the principal components need to be kept
keeping only the first principal components produced by using only the first eigenvectors gives the truncated transformation where the matrix tl now has rows but only columns
in other words pca learns linear transformation where the columns of matrix form an orthogonal basis for the features the components of representation that are decorrelated
by construction of all the transformed data matrices with only columns this score matrix maximises the variance in the original data that has been preserved while minimising the total squared reconstruction error or such dimensionality reduction can be very useful step for visualising and processing high dimensional datasets while still retaining as much of the variance in the dataset as possible
for example selecting and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two dimensional plane through the high dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out so if the data contains clusters these too may be most spread out and therefore most visible to be plotted out in two dimensional diagram whereas if two directions through the data or two of the original variables are chosen at random the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other making them indistinguishable
similarly in regression analysis the larger the number of explanatory variables allowed the greater is the chance of overfitting the model producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets
one approach especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables is to reduce them to few principal components and then run the regression against them method called principal component regression
dimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in dataset are noisy
if each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed gaussian noise then the columns of will also contain similarly identically distributed gaussian noise such distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix which can be thought of as high dimensional rotation of the co ordinate axes
however with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance the proportionate effect of the noise is less the first few components achieve higher signal to noise ratio
pca thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction while the later principal components may be dominated by noise and so disposed of without great loss
if the dataset is not too large the significance of the principal components can be tested using parametric bootstrap as an aid in determining how many principal components to retain
singular value decomposition the principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization the singular value decomposition svd of here is an by rectangular diagonal matrix of positive numbers called the singular values of is an by matrix the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length called the left singular vectors of and is by whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length and called the right singular vectors of in terms of this factorization the matrix xtx can be written where is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values of and the excess zeros chopped off that satisfies comparison with the eigenvector factorization of xtx establishes that the right singular vectors of are equivalent to the eigenvectors of xtx while the singular values of are equal to the square root of the eigenvalues of xtx
using the singular value decomposition the score matrix can be written so each column of is given by one of the left singular vectors of multiplied by the corresponding singular value
this form is also the polar decomposition of efficient algorithms exist to calculate the svd of without having to form the matrix xtx so computing the svd is now the standard way to calculate principal components analysis from data matrix unless only handful of components are required
as with the eigen decomposition truncated score matrix tl can be obtained by considering only the first largest singular values and their singular vectors the truncation of matrix or using truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of rank to the original matrix in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible frobenius norm result known as the eckart young theorem
further considerations the singular values in are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix xtx
each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the variance more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean that is associated with each eigenvector
the sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean
pca essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components
this moves as much of the variance as possible using an orthogonal transformation into the first few dimensions
the values in the remaining dimensions therefore tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information see below
pca is often used in this manner for dimensionality reduction
pca has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest variance as defined above
this advantage however comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared for example and when applicable to the discrete cosine transform and in particular to the dct ii which is simply known as the dct
nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than pca
pca is sensitive to the scaling of the variables
if we have just two variables and they have the same sample variance and are completely correlated then the pca will entail rotation by and the weights they are the cosines of rotation for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal
but if we multiply all values of the first variable by then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable with small contribution from the other variable whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable
this means that whenever the different variables have different units like temperature and mass pca is somewhat arbitrary method of analysis
different results would be obtained if one used fahrenheit rather than celsius for example
pearson original paper was entitled on lines and planes of closest fit to systems of points in space in space implies physical euclidean space where such concerns do not arise
one way of making the pca less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as basis for pca
however this compresses or expands the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance
mean centering is necessary for performing classical pca to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance
if mean subtraction is not performed the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data
mean of zero is needed for finding basis that minimizes the mean square error of the approximation of the data mean centering is unnecessary if performing principal components analysis on correlation matrix as the data are already centered after calculating correlations
correlations are derived from the cross product of two standard scores scores or statistical moments hence the name pearson product moment correlation
also see the article by kromrey foster johnson on mean centering in moderated regression much ado about nothing
since covariances are correlations of normalized variables or standard scores pca based on the correlation matrix of is equal to pca based on the covariance matrix of the standardized version of pca is popular primary technique in pattern recognition
it is not however optimized for class separability
however it has been used to quantify the distance between two or more classes by calculating center of mass for each class in principal component space and reporting euclidean distance between center of mass of two or more classes
the linear discriminant analysis is an alternative which is optimized for class separability
table of symbols and abbreviations properties and limitations of pca properties some properties of pca include property for any integer consider the orthogonal linear transformation where is element vector and is matrix and let be the variance covariance matrix for then the trace of denoted tr is maximized by taking where consists of the first columns of is the transpose of property consider again the orthonormal transformation with and defined as before
then tr is minimized by taking where consists of the last columns of the statistical implication of this property is that the last few pcs are not simply unstructured left overs after removing the important pcs
because these last pcs have variances as small as possible they are useful in their own right
they can help to detect unsuspected near constant linear relationships between the elements of and they may also be useful in regression in selecting subset of variables from and in outlier detection
property spectral decomposition of before we look at its usage we first look at diagonal elements var then perhaps the main statistical implication of the result is that not only can we decompose the combined variances of all the elements of into decreasing contributions due to each pc but we can also decompose the whole covariance matrix into contributions from each pc
although not strictly decreasing the elements of will tend to become smaller as increases as is nonincreasing for increasing whereas the elements of tend to stay about the same size because of the normalization constraints limitations as noted above the results of pca depend on the scaling of the variables
this can be cured by scaling each feature by its standard deviation so that one ends up with dimensionless features with unital variance the applicability of pca as described above is limited by certain tacit assumptions made in its derivation
in particular pca can capture linear correlations between the features but fails when this assumption is violated see figure in the reference
in some cases coordinate transformations can restore the linearity assumption and pca can then be applied see kernel pca
another limitation is the mean removal process before constructing the covariance matrix for pca
in fields such as astronomy all the signals are non negative and the mean removal process will force the mean of some astrophysical exposures to be zero which consequently creates unphysical negative fluxes and forward modeling has to be performed to recover the true magnitude of the signals
as an alternative method non negative matrix factorization focusing only on the non negative elements in the matrices which is well suited for astrophysical observations
see more at relation between pca and non negative matrix factorization
pca is at disadvantage if the data has not been standardized before applying the algorithm to it
pca transforms original data into data that is relevant to the principal components of that data which means that the new data variables cannot be interpreted in the same ways that the originals were
they are linear interpretations of the original variables
also if pca is not performed properly there is high likelihood of information loss pca relies on linear model
if dataset has pattern hidden inside it that is nonlinear then pca can actually steer the analysis in the complete opposite direction of progress
researchers at kansas state university discovered that the sampling error in their experiments impacted the bias of pca results
if the number of subjects or blocks is smaller than and or the researcher is interested in pc beyond the first it may be better to first correct for the serial correlation before pca is conducted
the researchers at kansas state also found that pca could be seriously biased if the autocorrelation structure of the data is not correctly handled
pca and information theory dimensionality reduction results in loss of information in general
pca based dimensionality reduction tends to minimize that information loss under certain signal and noise models
under the assumption that that is that the data vector is the sum of the desired information bearing signal and noise signal one can show that pca can be optimal for dimensionality reduction from an information theoretic point of view
in particular linsker showed that if is gaussian and is gaussian noise with covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix the pca maximizes the mutual information between the desired information and the dimensionality reduced output if the noise is still gaussian and has covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix that is the components of the vector are iid but the information bearing signal is non gaussian which is common scenario pca at least minimizes an upper bound on the information loss which is defined as
the optimality of pca is also preserved if the noise is iid and at least more gaussian in terms of the kullback leibler divergence than the information bearing signal in general even if the above signal model holds pca loses its information theoretic optimality as soon as the noise becomes dependent
computing pca using the covariance method the following is detailed description of pca using the covariance method see also here as opposed to the correlation method the goal is to transform given data set of dimension to an alternative data set of smaller dimension equivalently we are seeking to find the matrix where is the karhunen lo ve transform klt of matrix organize the data setsuppose you have data comprising set of observations of variables and you want to reduce the data so that each observation can be described with only variables suppose further that the data are arranged as set of data vectors with each representing single grouped observation of the variables
write as row vectors each with elements
place the row vectors into single matrix of dimensions calculate the empirical meanfind the empirical mean along each column place the calculated mean values into an empirical mean vector of dimensions calculate the deviations from the meanmean subtraction is an integral part of the solution towards finding principal component basis that minimizes the mean square error of approximating the data
hence we proceed by centering the data as follows subtract the empirical mean vector from each row of the data matrix store mean subtracted data in the matrix where is an column vector of all for in some applications each variable column of may also be scaled to have variance equal to see score
this step affects the calculated principal components but makes them independent of the units used to measure the different variables
find the covariance matrixfind the empirical covariance matrix from matrix where is the conjugate transpose operator
if consists entirely of real numbers which is the case in many applications the conjugate transpose is the same as the regular transpose
the reasoning behind using instead of to calculate the covariance is bessel correction find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrixcompute the matrix of eigenvectors which diagonalizes the covariance matrix where is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of this step will typically involve the use of computer based algorithm for computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues
these algorithms are readily available as sub components of most matrix algebra systems such as sas matlab mathematica scipy idl interactive data language or gnu octave as well as opencv
matrix will take the form of an diagonal matrix where is the jth eigenvalue of the covariance matrix and matrix also of dimension contains column vectors each of length which represent the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are ordered and paired
the jth eigenvalue corresponds to the jth eigenvector
matrix denotes the matrix of right eigenvectors as opposed to left eigenvectors
in general the matrix of right eigenvectors need not be the conjugate transpose of the matrix of left eigenvectors rearrange the eigenvectors and eigenvaluessort the columns of the eigenvector matrix and eigenvalue matrix in order of decreasing eigenvalue
make sure to maintain the correct pairings between the columns in each matrix compute the cumulative energy content for each eigenvectorthe eigenvalues represent the distribution of the source data energy among each of the eigenvectors where the eigenvectors form basis for the data
the cumulative energy content for the jth eigenvector is the sum of the energy content across all of the eigenvalues from through for select subset of the eigenvectors as basis vectorssave the first columns of as the matrix where use the vector as guide in choosing an appropriate value for the goal is to choose value of as small as possible while achieving reasonably high value of on percentage basis
for example you may want to choose so that the cumulative energy is above certain threshold like percent
in this case choose the smallest value of such that project the data onto the new basisthe projected data points are the rows of the matrix that is the first column of is the projection of the data points onto the first principal component the second column is the projection onto the second principal component etc
derivation of pca using the covariance method let be dimensional random vector expressed as column vector
without loss of generality assume has zero mean
we want to find orthonormal transformation matrix so that px has diagonal covariance matrix that is px is random vector with all its distinct components pairwise uncorrelated
quick computation assuming were unitary yields cov cov hence holds if and only if cov were diagonalisable by this is very constructive as cov is guaranteed to be non negative definite matrix and thus is guaranteed to be diagonalisable by some unitary matrix
covariance free computation in practical implementations especially with high dimensional data large the naive covariance method is rarely used because it is not efficient due to high computational and memory costs of explicitly determining the covariance matrix
the covariance free approach avoids the np operations of explicitly calculating and storing the covariance matrix xtx instead utilizing one of matrix free methods for example based on the function evaluating the product xt at the cost of np operations
iterative computation one way to compute the first principal component efficiently is shown in the following pseudo code for data matrix with zero mean without ever computing its covariance matrix
random vector of length norm do times vector of length for each row in rts is the eigenvalue error norm exit if error tolerance return this power iteration algorithm simply calculates the vector xt normalizes and places the result back in the eigenvalue is approximated by rt xtx which is the rayleigh quotient on the unit vector for the covariance matrix xtx
if the largest singular value is well separated from the next largest one the vector gets close to the first principal component of within the number of iterations which is small relative to at the total cost cnp
the power iteration convergence can be accelerated without noticeably sacrificing the small cost per iteration using more advanced matrix free methods such as the lanczos algorithm or the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient lobpcg method
subsequent principal components can be computed one by one via deflation or simultaneously as block
in the former approach imprecisions in already computed approximate principal components additively affect the accuracy of the subsequently computed principal components thus increasing the error with every new computation
the latter approach in the block power method replaces single vectors and with block vectors matrices and every column of approximates one of the leading principal components while all columns are iterated simultaneously
the main calculation is evaluation of the product xt
implemented for example in lobpcg efficient blocking eliminates the accumulation of the errors allows using high level blas matrix matrix product functions and typically leads to faster convergence compared to the single vector one by one technique
the nipals method non linear iterative partial least squares nipals is variant the classical power iteration with matrix deflation by subtraction implemented for computing the first few components in principal component or partial least squares analysis
for very high dimensional datasets such as those generated in the omics sciences for example genomics metabolomics it is usually only necessary to compute the first few pcs
the non linear iterative partial least squares nipals algorithm updates iterative approximations to the leading scores and loadings and by the power iteration multiplying on every iteration by on the left and on the right that is calculation of the covariance matrix is avoided just as in the matrix free implementation of the power iterations to xtx based on the function evaluating the product xt tx the matrix deflation by subtraction is performed by subtracting the outer product from leaving the deflated residual matrix used to calculate the subsequent leading pcs
for large data matrices or matrices that have high degree of column collinearity nipals suffers from loss of orthogonality of pcs due to machine precision round off errors accumulated in each iteration and matrix deflation by subtraction
gram schmidt re orthogonalization algorithm is applied to both the scores and the loadings at each iteration step to eliminate this loss of orthogonality
nipals reliance on single vector multiplications cannot take advantage of high level blas and results in slow convergence for clustered leading singular values both these deficiencies are resolved in more sophisticated matrix free block solvers such as the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient lobpcg method
online sequential estimation in an online or streaming situation with data arriving piece by piece rather than being stored in single batch it is useful to make an estimate of the pca projection that can be updated sequentially
this can be done efficiently but requires different algorithms
pca and qualitative variables in pca it is common that we want to introduce qualitative variables as supplementary elements
for example many quantitative variables have been measured on plants
for these plants some qualitative variables are available as for example the species to which the plant belongs
these data were subjected to pca for quantitative variables
when analyzing the results it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable species
for this the following results are produced
identification on the factorial planes of the different species for example using different colors
representation on the factorial planes of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species
for each center of gravity and each axis value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin these results are what is called introducing qualitative variable as supplementary element
this procedure is detailed in and husson pag and pag few software offer this option in an automatic way
this is the case of spad that historically following the work of ludovic lebart was the first to propose this option and the package factominer
applications intelligence the earliest application of factor analysis was in locating and measuring components of human intelligence
it was believed that intelligence had various uncorrelated components such as spatial intelligence verbal intelligence induction deduction etc and that scores on these could be adduced by factor analysis from results on various tests to give single index known as the intelligence quotient iq
the pioneering statistical psychologist spearman actually developed factor analysis in for his two factor theory of intelligence adding formal technique to the science of psychometrics
in thurstone looked for factors of intelligence developing the notion of mental age
standard iq tests today are based on this early work
residential differentiation in shevky and williams introduced the theory of factorial ecology which dominated studies of residential differentiation from the to the
neighbourhoods in city were recognizable or could be distinguished from one another by various characteristics which could be reduced to three by factor analysis
these were known as social rank an index of occupational status familism or family size and ethnicity cluster analysis could then be applied to divide the city into clusters or precincts according to values of the three key factor variables
an extensive literature developed around factorial ecology in urban geography but the approach went out of fashion after as being methodologically primitive and having little place in postmodern geographical paradigms
one of the problems with factor analysis has always been finding convincing names for the various artificial factors
in flood revived the factorial ecology approach to show that principal components analysis actually gave meaningful answers directly without resorting to factor rotation
the principal components were actually dual variables or shadow prices of forces pushing people together or apart in cities
the first component was accessibility the classic trade off between demand for travel and demand for space around which classical urban economics is based
the next two components were disadvantage which keeps people of similar status in separate neighbourhoods mediated by planning and ethnicity where people of similar ethnic backgrounds try to co locate about the same time the australian bureau of statistics defined distinct indexes of advantage and disadvantage taking the first principal component of sets of key variables that were thought to be important
these seifa indexes are regularly published for various jurisdictions and are used frequently in spatial analysis
development indexes pca has been the only formal method available for the development of indexes which are otherwise hit or miss ad hoc undertaking
the city development index was developed by pca from about indicators of city outcomes in survey of global cities
the first principal component was subject to iterative regression adding the original variables singly until about of its variation was accounted for
the index ultimately used about indicators but was good predictor of many more variables
its comparative value agreed very well with subjective assessment of the condition of each city
the coefficients on items of infrastructure were roughly proportional to the average costs of providing the underlying services suggesting the index was actually measure of effective physical and social investment in the city
the country level human development index hdi from undp which has been published since and is very extensively used in development studies has very similar coefficients on similar indicators strongly suggesting it was originally constructed using pca
population genetics in cavalli sforza and others pioneered the use of principal components analysis pca to summarise data on variation in human gene frequencies across regions
the components showed distinctive patterns including gradients and sinusoidal waves
they interpreted these patterns as resulting from specific ancient migration events
since then pca has been ubiquitous in population genetics with thousands of papers using pca as display mechanism
genetics varies largely according to proximity so the first two principal components actually show spatial distribution and may be used to map the relative geographical location of different population groups thereby showing individuals who have wandered from their original locations pca in genetics has been technically controversial in that the technique has been performed on discrete non normal variables and often on binary allele markers
the lack of any measures of standard error in pca are also an impediment to more consistent usage
in august the molecular biologist eran elhaik published theoretical paper in scientific reports analyzing pca applications
he concluded that it was easy to manipulate the method which in his view generated results that were erroneous contradictory and absurd
specifically he argued the results achieved in population genetics were characterized by cherry picking and circular reasoning
market research and indexes of attitude market research has been an extensive user of pca
it is used to develop customer satisfaction or customer loyalty scores for products and with clustering to develop market segments that may be targeted with advertising campaigns in much the same way as factorial ecology will locate geographical areas with similar characteristics pca rapidly transforms large amounts of data into smaller easier to digest variables that can be more rapidly and readily analyzed
in any consumer questionnaire there are series of questions designed to elicit consumer attitudes and principal components seek out latent variables underlying these attitudes
for example the oxford internet survey in asked people about their attitudes and beliefs and from these analysts extracted four principal component dimensions which they identified as escape social networking efficiency and problem creating another example from joe flood in extracted an attitudinal index toward housing from attitude questions in national survey of households in australia
the first principal component represented general attitude toward property and home ownership
the index or the attitude questions it embodied could be fed into general linear model of tenure choice
the strongest determinant of private renting by far was the attitude index rather than income marital status or household type
quantitative finance in quantitative finance principal component analysis can be directly applied to the risk management of interest rate derivative portfolios
trading multiple swap instruments which are usually function of other market quotable swap instruments is sought to be reduced to usually or principal components representing the path of interest rates on macro basis
converting risks to be represented as those to factor loadings or multipliers provides assessments and understanding beyond that available to simply collectively viewing risks to individual buckets
pca has also been applied to equity portfolios in similar fashion both to portfolio risk and to risk return
one application is to reduce portfolio risk where allocation strategies are applied to the principal portfolios instead of the underlying stocks
second is to enhance portfolio return using the principal components to select stocks with upside potential
neuroscience variant of principal components analysis is used in neuroscience to identify the specific properties of stimulus that increases neuron probability of generating an action potential
this technique is known as spike triggered covariance analysis
in typical application an experimenter presents white noise process as stimulus usually either as sensory input to test subject or as current injected directly into the neuron and records train of action potentials or spikes produced by the neuron as result
presumably certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike
in order to extract these features the experimenter calculates the covariance matrix of the spike triggered ensemble the set of all stimuli defined and discretized over finite time window typically on the order of ms that immediately preceded spike
the eigenvectors of the difference between the spike triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the prior stimulus ensemble the set of all stimuli defined over the same length time window then indicate the directions in the space of stimuli along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble
specifically the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the varince of the prior
since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to spike they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features
in neuroscience pca is also used to discern the identity of neuron from the shape of its action potential
spike sorting is an important procedure because extracellular recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron
in spike sorting one first uses pca to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms and then performs clustering analysis to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons
pca as dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles
it has been used in determining collective variables that is order parameters during phase transitions in the brain
relation with other methods correspondence analysis correspondence analysis ca was developed by jean paul benz cri and is conceptually similar to pca but scales the data which should be non negative so that rows and columns are treated equivalently
it is traditionally applied to contingency tables
ca decomposes the chi squared statistic associated to this table into orthogonal factors
because ca is descriptive technique it can be applied to tables for which the chi squared statistic is appropriate or not
several variants of ca are available including detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis
one special extension is multiple correspondence analysis which may be seen as the counterpart of principal component analysis for categorical data
factor analysis principal component analysis creates variables that are linear combinations of the original variables
the new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal
the pca transformation can be helpful as pre processing step before clustering
pca is variance focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable
pca is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction that is translating variable space into optimal factor space but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors
factor analysis is similar to principal component analysis in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables
different from pca factor analysis is correlation focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter correlations among variables in which the factors represent the common variance of variables excluding unique variance
in terms of the correlation matrix this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off diagonal terms that is shared co variance while pca focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal
however as side result when trying to reproduce the on diagonal terms pca also tends to fit relatively well the off diagonal correlations
results given by pca and factor analysis are very similar in most situations but this is not always the case and there are some problems where the results are significantly different
factor analysis is generally used when the research purpose is detecting data structure that is latent constructs or factors or causal modeling
if the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met then factor analysis will give erroneous results
means clustering it has been asserted that the relaxed solution of means clustering specified by the cluster indicators is given by the principal components and the pca subspace spanned by the principal directions is identical to the cluster centroid subspace
however that pca is useful relaxation of means clustering was not new result and it is straightforward to uncover counterexamples to the statement that the cluster centroid subspace is spanned by the principal directions
non negative matrix factorization non negative matrix factorization nmf is dimension reduction method where only non negative elements in the matrices are used which is therefore promising method in astronomy in the sense that astrophysical signals are non negative
the pca components are orthogonal to each other while the nmf components are all non negative and therefore constructs non orthogonal basis
in pca the contribution of each component is ranked based on the magnitude of its corresponding eigenvalue which is equivalent to the fractional residual variance frv in analyzing empirical data
for nmf its components are ranked based only on the empirical frv curves
the residual fractional eigenvalue plots that is as function of component number given total of components for pca has flat plateau where no data is captured to remove the quasi static noise then the curves dropped quickly as an indication of over fitting and captures random noise
the frv curves for nmf is decreasing continuously when the nmf components are constructed sequentially indicating the continuous capturing of quasi static noise then converge to higher levels than pca indicating the less over fitting property of nmf
iconography of correlations it is often difficult to interpret the principal components when the data include many variables of various origins or when some variables are qualitative
this leads the pca user to delicate elimination of several variables
if observations or variables have an excessive impact on the direction of the axes they should be removed and then projected as supplementary elements
in addition it is necessary to avoid interpreting the proximities between the points close to the center of the factorial plane
the iconography of correlations on the contrary which is not projection on system of axes does not have these drawbacks
we can therefore keep all the variables
the principle of the diagram is to underline the remarkable correlations of the correlation matrix by solid line positive correlation or dotted line negative correlation
strong correlation is not remarkable if it is not direct but caused by the effect of third variable
conversely weak correlations can be remarkable
for example if variable depends on several independent variables the correlations of with each of them are weak and yet remarkable
generalizations sparse pca particular disadvantage of pca is that the principal components are usually linear combinations of all input variables
sparse pca overcomes this disadvantage by finding linear combinations that contain just few input variables
it extends the classic method of principal component analysis pca for the reduction of dimensionality of data by adding sparsity constraint on the input variables
several approaches have been proposed including regression framework convex relaxation semidefinite programming framework generalized power method framework an alternating maximization framework forward backward greedy search and exact methods using branch and bound techniques bayesian formulation framework the methodological and theoretical developments of sparse pca as well as its applications in scientific studies were recently reviewed in survey paper
nonlinear pca most of the modern methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction find their theoretical and algorithmic roots in pca or means
pearson original idea was to take straight line or plane which will be the best fit to set of data points
trevor hastie expanded on this concept by proposing principal curves as the natural extension for the geometric interpretation of pca which explicitly constructs manifold for data approximation followed by projecting the points onto it as is illustrated by fig
see also the elastic map algorithm and principal geodesic analysis
another popular generalization is kernel pca which corresponds to pca performed in reproducing kernel hilbert space associated with positive definite kernel
in multilinear subspace learning pca is generalized to multilinear pca mpca that extracts features directly from tensor representations
mpca is solved by performing pca in each mode of the tensor iteratively
mpca has been applied to face recognition gait recognition etc
mpca is further extended to uncorrelated mpca non negative mpca and robust mpca
way principal component analysis may be performed with models such as tucker decomposition parafac multiple factor analysis co inertia analysis statis and distatis
robust pca while pca finds the mathematically optimal method as in minimizing the squared error it is still sensitive to outliers in the data that produce large errors something that the method tries to avoid in the first place
it is therefore common practice to remove outliers before computing pca
however in some contexts outliers can be difficult to identify
for example in data mining algorithms like correlation clustering the assignment of points to clusters and outliers is not known beforehand
recently proposed generalization of pca based on weighted pca increases robustness by assigning different weights to data objects based on their estimated relevancy
outlier resistant variants of pca have also been proposed based on norm formulations pca robust principal component analysis rpca via decomposition in low rank and sparse matrices is modification of pca that works well with respect to grossly corrupted observations
similar techniques independent component analysis independent component analysis ica is directed to similar problems as principal component analysis but finds additively separable components rather than successive approximations
network component analysis given matrix it tries to decompose it into two matrices such that key difference from techniques such as pca and ica is that some of the entries of are constrained to be here is termed the regulatory layer
while in general such decomposition can have multiple solutions they prove that if the following conditions are satisfied has full column rank each column of must have at least zeroes where is the number of columns of or alternatively the number of rows of
the justification for this criterion is that if node is removed from the regulatory layer along with all the output nodes connected to it the result must still be characterized by connectivity matrix with full column rank
must have full row rank then the decomposition is unique up to multiplication by scalar
discriminant analysis of principal components discriminant analysis of principal components dapc is multivariate method used to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals
genetic variation is partitioned into two components variation between groups and within groups and it maximizes the former
linear discriminants are linear combinations of alleles which best separate the clusters
alleles that most contribute to this discrimination are therefore those that are the most markedly different across groups
the contributions of alleles to the groupings identified by dapc can allow identifying regions of the genome driving the genetic divergence among groups in dapc data is first transformed using principal components analysis pca and subsequently clusters are identified using discriminant analysis da

in linear algebra the singular value decomposition svd is factorization of real or complex matrix
it generalizes the eigendecomposition of square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any matrix
it is related to the polar decomposition
specifically the singular value decomposition of an complex matrix is factorization of the form where is an complex unitary matrix is an rectangular diagonal matrix with non negative real numbers on the diagonal is an complex unitary matrix and is the conjugate transpose of such decomposition always exists for any complex matrix
if is real then and can be guaranteed to be real orthogonal matrices in such contexts the svd is often denoted the diagonal entries of are uniquely determined by and are known as the singular values of the number of non zero singular values is equal to the rank of the columns of and the columns of are called left singular vectors and right singular vectors of respectively
they form two sets of orthonormal bases um and vn and if they are sorted so that the singular values with value zero are all in the highest numbered columns or rows the singular value decomposition can be written as where min is the rank of the svd is not unique
it is always possible to choose the decomposition so that the singular values are in descending order
in this case but not and is uniquely determined by the term sometimes refers to the compact svd similar decomposition in which is square diagonal of size where min is the rank of and has only the non zero singular values
in this variant is an semi unitary matrix and is an semi unitary matrix such that mathematical applications of the svd include computing the pseudoinverse matrix approximation and determining the rank range and null space of matrix
the svd is also extremely useful in all areas of science engineering and statistics such as signal processing least squares fitting of data and process control
intuitive interpretations rotation coordinate scaling and reflection in the special case when is an real square matrix the matrices and can be chosen to be real matrices too
in that case unitary is the same as orthogonal
then interpreting both unitary matrices as well as the diagonal matrix summarized here as as linear transformation ax of the space rm the matrices and represent rotations or reflection of the space while represents the scaling of each coordinate xi by the factor
thus the svd decomposition breaks down any linear transformation of rm into composition of three geometrical transformations rotation or reflection followed by coordinate by coordinate scaling followed by another rotation or reflection
in particular if has positive determinant then and can be chosen to be both rotations with reflections or both rotations without reflections
if the determinant is negative exactly one of them will have reflection
if the determinant is zero each can be independently chosen to be of either type
if the matrix is real but not square namely with it can be interpreted as linear transformation from rn to rm
then and can be chosen to be rotations reflections of rm and rn respectively and besides scaling the first min coordinates also extends the vector with zeros
removes trailing coordinates so as to turn rn into rm
singular values as semiaxes of an ellipse or ellipsoid as shown in the figure the singular values can be interpreted as the magnitude of the semiaxes of an ellipse in
this concept can be generalized to dimensional euclidean space with the singular values of any square matrix being viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an dimensional ellipsoid
similarly the singular values of any matrix can be viewed as the magnitude of the semiaxis of an dimensional ellipsoid in dimensional space for example as an ellipse in tilted plane in space
singular values encode magnitude of the semiaxis while singular vectors encode direction
see below for further details
the columns of and are orthonormal bases since and are unitary the columns of each of them form set of orthonormal vectors which can be regarded as basis vectors
the matrix maps the basis vector vi to the stretched unit vector ui
by the definition of unitary matrix the same is true for their conjugate transposes and except the geometric interpretation of the singular values as stretches is lost
in short the columns of and are orthonormal bases
when the is positive semidefinite hermitian matrix and are both equal to the unitary matrix used to diagonalize however when is not positive semidefinite and hermitian but still diagonalizable its eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition are distinct
geometric meaning because and are unitary we know that the columns um of yield an orthonormal basis of km and the columns vn of yield an orthonormal basis of kn with respect to the standard scalar products on these spaces
the linear transformation has particularly simple description with respect to these orthonormal bases we have min where is the th diagonal entry of and vi for min
the geometric content of the svd theorem can thus be summarized as follows for every linear map kn km one can find orthonormal bases of kn and km such that maps the th basis vector of kn to non negative multiple of the th basis vector of km and sends the left over basis vectors to zero
with respect to these bases the map is therefore represented by diagonal matrix with non negative real diagonal entries
to get more visual flavor of singular values and svd factorization at least when working on real vector spaces consider the sphere of radius one in rn
the linear map maps this sphere onto an ellipsoid in rm
non zero singular values are simply the lengths of the semi axes of this ellipsoid
especially when and all the singular values are distinct and non zero the svd of the linear map can be easily analyzed as succession of three consecutive moves consider the ellipsoid and specifically its axes then consider the directions in rn sent by onto these axes
these directions happen to be mutually orthogonal
apply first an isometry sending these directions to the coordinate axes of rn
on second move apply an endomorphism diagonalized along the coordinate axes and stretching or shrinking in each direction using the semi axes lengths of as stretching coefficients
the composition then sends the unit sphere onto an ellipsoid isometric to
to define the third and last move apply an isometry to this ellipsoid to obtain
as can be easily checked the composition coincides with example consider the matrix singular value decomposition of this matrix is given by the scaling matrix is zero outside of the diagonal grey italics and one diagonal element is zero red bold
furthermore because the matrices and are unitary multiplying by their respective conjugate transposes yields identity matrices as shown below
in this case because and are real valued each is an orthogonal matrix
this particular singular value decomposition is not unique
choosing such that is also valid singular value decomposition
svd and spectral decomposition singular values singular vectors and their relation to the svd non negative real number is singular value for if and only if there exist unit length vectors in km and in kn such that and the vectors and are called left singular and right singular vectors for respectively
in any singular value decomposition the diagonal entries of are equal to the singular values of the first min columns of and are respectively left and right singular vectors for the corresponding singular values
consequently the above theorem implies that an matrix has at most distinct singular values
it is always possible to find unitary basis for km with subset of basis vectors spanning the left singular vectors of each singular value of it is always possible to find unitary basis for kn with subset of basis vectors spanning the right singular vectors of each singular value of singular value for which we can find two left or right singular vectors that are linearly independent is called degenerate
if and are two left singular vectors which both correspond to the singular value then any normalized linear combination of the two vectors is also left singular vector corresponding to the singular value the similar statement is true for right singular vectors
the number of independent left and right singular vectors coincides and these singular vectors appear in the same columns of and corresponding to diagonal elements of all with the same value as an exception the left and right singular vectors of singular value comprise all unit vectors in the kernel and cokernel respectively of which by the rank nullity theorem cannot be the same dimension if even if all singular values are nonzero if then the cokernel is nontrivial in which case is padded with orthogonal vectors from the cokernel
conversely if then is padded by orthogonal vectors from the kernel
however if the singular value of exists the extra columns of or already appear as left or right singular vectors
non degenerate singular values always have unique left and right singular vectors up to multiplication by unit phase factor ei for the real case up to sign
consequently if all singular values of square matrix are non degenerate and non zero then its singular value decomposition is unique up to multiplication of column of by unit phase factor and simultaneous multiplication of the corresponding column of by the same unit phase factor
in general the svd is unique up to arbitrary unitary transformations applied uniformly to the column vectors of both and spanning the subspaces of each singular value and up to arbitrary unitary transformations on vectors of and spanning the kernel and cokernel respectively of relation to eigenvalue decomposition the singular value decomposition is very general in the sense that it can be applied to any matrix whereas eigenvalue decomposition can only be applied to diagonalizable matrices
nevertheless the two decompositions are related
given an svd of as described above the following two relations hold the right hand sides of these relations describe the eigenvalue decompositions of the left hand sides
consequently the columns of right singular vectors are eigenvectors of
the columns of left singular vectors are eigenvectors of mm
the non zero elements of non zero singular values are the square roots of the non zero eigenvalues of or mm in the special case that is normal matrix which by definition must be square the spectral theorem says that it can be unitarily diagonalized using basis of eigenvectors so that it can be written udu for unitary matrix and diagonal matrix with complex elements along the diagonal
when is positive semi definite will be non negative real numbers so that the decomposition udu is also singular value decomposition
otherwise it can be recast as an svd by moving the phase ei of each to either its corresponding vi or ui
the natural connection of the svd to non normal matrices is through the polar decomposition theorem sr where is positive semidefinite and normal and uv is unitary
thus except for positive semi definite matrices the eigenvalue decomposition and svd of while related differ the eigenvalue decomposition is udu where is not necessarily unitary and is not necessarily positive semi definite while the svd is where is diagonal and positive semi definite and and are unitary matrices that are not necessarily related except through the matrix while only non defective square matrices have an eigenvalue decomposition any matrix has svd
applications of the svd pseudoinverse the singular value decomposition can be used for computing the pseudoinverse of matrix
various authors use different notation for the pseudoinverse here we use
indeed the pseudoinverse of the matrix with singular value decomposition is where is the pseudoinverse of which is formed by replacing every non zero diagonal entry by its reciprocal and transposing the resulting matrix
the pseudoinverse is one way to solve linear least squares problems
solving homogeneous linear equations set of homogeneous linear equations can be written as ax for matrix and vector typical situation is that is known and non zero is to be determined which satisfies the equation
such an belongs to null space and is sometimes called right null vector of the vector can be characterized as right singular vector corresponding to singular value of that is zero
this observation means that if is square matrix and has no vanishing singular value the equation has no non zero as solution
it also means that if there are several vanishing singular values any linear combination of the corresponding right singular vectors is valid solution
analogously to the definition of right null vector non zero satisfying with denoting the conjugate transpose of is called left null vector of
total least squares minimization total least squares problem seeks the vector that minimizes the norm of vector ax under the constraint the solution turns out to be the right singular vector of corresponding to the smallest singular value
range null space and rank another application of the svd is that it provides an explicit representation of the range and null space of matrix the right singular vectors corresponding to vanishing singular values of span the null space of and the left singular vectors corresponding to the non zero singular values of span the range of for example in the above example the null space is spanned by the last two rows of and the range is spanned by the first three columns of as consequence the rank of equals the number of non zero singular values which is the same as the number of non zero diagonal elements in in numerical linear algebra the singular values can be used to determine the effective rank of matrix as rounding error may lead to small but non zero singular values in rank deficient matrix
singular values beyond significant gap are assumed to be numerically equivalent to zero
low rank matrix approximation some practical applications need to solve the problem of approximating matrix with another matrix said to be truncated which has specific rank in the case that the approximation is based on minimizing the frobenius norm of the difference between and under the constraint that rank it turns out that the solution is given by the svd of namely where is the same matrix as except that it contains only the largest singular values the other singular values are replaced by zero
this is known as the eckart young theorem as it was proved by those two authors in although it was later found to have been known to earlier authors see stewart
separable models the svd can be thought of as decomposing matrix into weighted ordered sum of separable matrices
by separable we mean that matrix can be written as an outer product of two vectors or in coordinates specifically the matrix can be decomposed as here ui and vi are the th columns of the corresponding svd matrices are the ordered singular values and each ai is separable
the svd can be used to find the decomposition of an image processing filter into separable horizontal and vertical filters
note that the number of non zero is exactly the rank of the matrix
separable models often arise in biological systems and the svd factorization is useful to analyze such systems
for example some visual area simple cells receptive fields can be well described by gabor filter in the space domain multiplied by modulation function in the time domain
thus given linear filter evaluated through for example reverse correlation one can rearrange the two spatial dimensions into one dimension thus yielding two dimensional filter space time which can be decomposed through svd
the first column of in the svd factorization is then gabor while the first column of represents the time modulation or vice versa
one may then define an index of separability which is the fraction of the power in the matrix which is accounted for by the first separable matrix in the decomposition
nearest orthogonal matrix it is possible to use the svd of square matrix to determine the orthogonal matrix closest to the closeness of fit is measured by the frobenius norm of the solution is the product uv
this intuitively makes sense because an orthogonal matrix would have the decomposition uiv where is the identity matrix so that if then the product uv amounts to replacing the singular values with ones
equivalently the solution is the unitary matrix uv of the polar decomposition rp in either order of stretch and rotation as described above
similar problem with interesting applications in shape analysis is the orthogonal procrustes problem which consists of finding an orthogonal matrix which most closely maps to specifically argmin subject to where denotes the frobenius norm
this problem is equivalent to finding the nearest orthogonal matrix to given matrix atb
the kabsch algorithm the kabsch algorithm called wahba problem in other fields uses svd to compute the optimal rotation with respect to least squares minimization that will align set of points with corresponding set of points
it is used among other applications to compare the structures of molecules
signal processing the svd and pseudoinverse have been successfully applied to signal processing image processing and big data in genomic signal processing
other examples the svd is also applied extensively to the study of linear inverse problems and is useful in the analysis of regularization methods such as that of tikhonov
it is widely used in statistics where it is related to principal component analysis and to correspondence analysis and in signal processing and pattern recognition
it is also used in output only modal analysis where the non scaled mode shapes can be determined from the singular vectors
yet another usage is latent semantic indexing in natural language text processing
in general numerical computation involving linear or linearized systems there is universal constant that characterizes the regularity or singularity of problem which is the system condition number max min
it often controls the error rate or convergence rate of given computational scheme on such systems the svd also plays crucial role in the field of quantum information in form often referred to as the schmidt decomposition
through it states of two quantum systems are naturally decomposed providing necessary and sufficient condition for them to be entangled if the rank of the matrix is larger than one
one application of svd to rather large matrices is in numerical weather prediction where lanczos methods are used to estimate the most linearly quickly growing few perturbations to the central numerical weather prediction over given initial forward time period the singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of the linearized propagator for the global weather over that time interval
the output singular vectors in this case are entire weather systems
these perturbations are then run through the full nonlinear model to generate an ensemble forecast giving handle on some of the uncertainty that should be allowed for around the current central prediction
svd has also been applied to reduced order modelling
the aim of reduced order modelling is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in complex system which is to be modeled
svd was coupled with radial basis functions to interpolate solutions to three dimensional unsteady flow problems interestingly svd has been used to improve gravitational waveform modeling by the ground based gravitational wave interferometer aligo
svd can help to increase the accuracy and speed of waveform generation to support gravitational waves searches and update two different waveform models
singular value decomposition is used in recommender systems to predict people item ratings
distributed algorithms have been developed for the purpose of calculating the svd on clusters of commodity machines low rank svd has been applied for hotspot detection from spatiotemporal data with application to disease outbreak detection
combination of svd and higher order svd also has been applied for real time event detection from complex data streams multivariate data with space and time dimensions in disease surveillance
existence proofs an eigenvalue of matrix is characterized by the algebraic relation mu
when is hermitian variational characterization is also available
let be real symmetric matrix
define by the extreme value theorem this continuous function attains maximum at some when restricted to the unit sphere
by the lagrange multipliers theorem necessarily satisfies for some real number the nabla symbol is the del operator differentiation with respect to
using the symmetry of we obtain therefore mu so is unit length eigenvector of for every unit length eigenvector of its eigenvalue is so is the largest eigenvalue of the same calculation performed on the orthogonal complement of gives the next largest eigenvalue and so on
the complex hermitian case is similar there is real valued function of real variables
singular values are similar in that they can be described algebraically or from variational principles
although unlike the eigenvalue case hermiticity or symmetry of is no longer required
this section gives these two arguments for existence of singular value decomposition
based on the spectral theorem let be an complex matrix
since is positive semi definite and hermitian by the spectral theorem there exists an unitary matrix such that where is diagonal and positive definite of dimension with the number of non zero eigenvalues of which can be shown to verify min
note that is here by definition matrix whose th column is the th eigenvector of corresponding to the eigenvalue moreover the th column of for is an eigenvector of with eigenvalue this can be expressed by writing as where the columns of and therefore contain the eigenvectors of corresponding to non zero and zero eigenvalues respectively
using this rewriting of the equation becomes
this implies that moreover the second equation implies finally the unitary ness of translates in terms of and into the following conditions where the subscripts on the identity matrices are used to remark that they are of different dimensions
let us now define then since this can be also seen as immediate consequence of the fact that this is equivalent to the observation that if is the set of eigenvectors of corresponding to non vanishing eigenvalues then is set of orthogonal vectors and is generally not complete set of orthonormal vectors
this matches with the matrix formalism used above denoting with the matrix whose columns are with the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of with vanishing eigenvalue and the matrix whose columns are the vectors we see that this is almost the desired result except that and are in general not unitary since they might not be square
however we do know that the number of rows of is no smaller than the number of columns since the dimensions of is no greater than and also since the columns in are orthonormal and can be extended to an orthonormal basis
this means that we can choose such that is unitary
for we already have to make it unitary
now define where extra zero rows are added or removed to make the number of zero rows equal the number of columns of and hence the overall dimensions of equal to then which is the desired result
notice the argument could begin with diagonalizing mm rather than this shows directly that mm and have the same non zero eigenvalues
based on variational characterization the singular values can also be characterized as the maxima of utmv considered as function of and over particular subspaces
the singular vectors are the values of and where these maxima are attained
let denote an matrix with real entries
let sk be the unit sphere in and define consider the function restricted to sm sn
since both sm and sn are compact sets their product is also compact
furthermore since is continuous it attains largest value for at least one pair of vectors sm and sn
this largest value is denoted and the corresponding vectors are denoted and
since is the largest value of it must be non negative
if it were negative changing the sign of either or would make it positive and therefore larger
are left and right singular vectors of with corresponding singular value
similar to the eigenvalues case by assumption the two vectors satisfy the lagrange multiplier equation after some algebra this becomes multiplying the first equation from left by and the second equation from left by and taking into account gives plugging this into the pair of equations above we have this proves the statement
more singular vectors and singular values can be found by maximizing over normalized which are orthogonal to and respectively
the passage from real to complex is similar to the eigenvalue case
calculating the svd the singular value decomposition can be computed using the following observations the left singular vectors of are set of orthonormal eigenvectors of mm
the right singular vectors of are set of orthonormal eigenvectors of
the non zero singular values of found on the diagonal entries of are the square roots of the non zero eigenvalues of both and mm
numerical approach the svd of matrix is typically computed by two step procedure
in the first step the matrix is reduced to bidiagonal matrix
this takes mn floating point operations flop assuming that the second step is to compute the svd of the bidiagonal matrix
this step can only be done with an iterative method as with eigenvalue algorithms
however in practice it suffices to compute the svd up to certain precision like the machine epsilon
if this precision is considered constant then the second step takes iterations each costing flops
thus the first step is more expensive and the overall cost is mn flops trefethen bau iii lecture
the first step can be done using householder reflections for cost of mn flops assuming that only the singular values are needed and not the singular vectors
if is much larger than then it is advantageous to first reduce the matrix to triangular matrix with the qr decomposition and then use householder reflections to further reduce the matrix to bidiagonal form the combined cost is mn flops trefethen bau iii lecture
the second step can be done by variant of the qr algorithm for the computation of eigenvalues which was first described by golub kahan
the lapack subroutine dbdsqr implements this iterative method with some modifications to cover the case where the singular values are very small demmel kahan
together with first step using householder reflections and if appropriate qr decomposition this forms the dgesvd routine for the computation of the singular value decomposition
the same algorithm is implemented in the gnu scientific library gsl
the gsl also offers an alternative method that uses one sided jacobi orthogonalization in step gsl team
this method computes the svd of the bidiagonal matrix by solving sequence of svd problems similar to how the jacobi eigenvalue algorithm solves sequence of eigenvalue methods golub van loan
yet another method for step uses the idea of divide and conquer eigenvalue algorithms trefethen bau iii lecture
there is an alternative way that does not explicitly use the eigenvalue decomposition
usually the singular value problem of matrix is converted into an equivalent symmetric eigenvalue problem such as or
the approaches that use eigenvalue decompositions are based on the qr algorithm which is well developed to be stable and fast
note that the singular values are real and right and left singular vectors are not required to form similarity transformations
one can iteratively alternate between the qr decomposition and the lq decomposition to find the real diagonal hermitian matrices
the qr decomposition gives and the lq decomposition of gives
thus at every iteration we have update and repeat the orthogonalizations
eventually this iteration between qr decomposition and lq decomposition produces left and right unitary singular matrices
this approach cannot readily be accelerated as the qr algorithm can with spectral shifts or deflation
this is because the shift method is not easily defined without using similarity transformations
however this iterative approach is very simple to implement so is good choice when speed does not matter
this method also provides insight into how purely orthogonal unitary transformations can obtain the svd
analytic result of svd the singular values of matrix can be found analytically
let the matrix be where are complex numbers that parameterize the matrix is the identity matrix and denote the pauli matrices
then its two singular values are given by re re re im im im reduced svds in applications it is quite unusual for the full svd including full unitary decomposition of the null space of the matrix to be required
instead it is often sufficient as well as faster and more economical for storage to compute reduced version of the svd
the following can be distinguished for an matrix of rank thin svd the thin or economy sized svd of matrix is given by where min the matrices uk and vk contain only the first columns of and and contains only the first singular values from the matrix uk is thus is diagonal and vk is
the thin svd uses significantly less space and computation time if max
the first stage in its calculation will usually be qr decomposition of which can make for significantly quicker calculation in this case
compact svd only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the non zero singular values are calculated
the remaining vectors of and are not calculated
this is quicker and more economical than the thin svd if min
the matrix ur is thus is diagonal and vr is
truncated svd in many applications the number of the non zero singular values is large making even the compact svd impractical to compute
in such cases the smallest singular values may need to be truncated to compute only non zero singular values
the truncated svd is no longer an exact decomposition of the original matrix but rather provides the optimal low rank matrix approximation by any matrix of fixed rank where matrix ut is is diagonal and vt is
only the column vectors of and row vectors of corresponding to the largest singular values are calculated
this can be much quicker and more economical than the compact svd if but requires completely different toolset of numerical solvers
in applications that require an approximation to the moore penrose inverse of the matrix the smallest singular values of are of interest which are more challenging to compute compared to the largest ones
truncated svd is employed in latent semantic indexing
norms ky fan norms the sum of the largest singular values of is matrix norm the ky fan norm of the first of the ky fan norms the ky fan norm is the same as the operator norm of as linear operator with respect to the euclidean norms of km and kn
in other words the ky fan norm is the operator norm induced by the standard euclidean inner product
for this reason it is also called the operator norm
one can easily verify the relationship between the ky fan norm and singular values
it is true in general for bounded operator on possibly infinite dimensional hilbert spaces but in the matrix case is normal matrix so is the largest eigenvalue of
the largest singular value of the last of the ky fan norms the sum of all singular values is the trace norm also known as the nuclear norm defined by tr the eigenvalues of are the squares of the singular values
hilbert schmidt norm the singular values are related to another norm on the space of operators
consider the hilbert schmidt inner product on the matrices defined by tr
so the induced norm is tr
since the trace is invariant under unitary equivalence this shows where are the singular values of this is called the frobenius norm schatten norm or hilbert schmidt norm of direct calculation shows that the frobenius norm of mij coincides with in addition the frobenius norm and the trace norm the nuclear norm are special cases of the schatten norm
variations and generalizations mode representation can be represented using mode multiplication of matrix applying then on the result that is tensor svd two types of tensor decompositions exist which generalise the svd to multi way arrays
one of them decomposes tensor into sum of rank tensors which is called tensor rank decomposition
the second type of decomposition computes the orthonormal subspaces associated with the different factors appearing in the tensor product of vector spaces in which the tensor lives
this decomposition is referred to in the literature as the higher order svd hosvd or tucker tuckerm
in addition multilinear principal component analysis in multilinear subspace learning involves the same mathematical operations as tucker decomposition being used in different context of dimensionality reduction
scale invariant svd the singular values of matrix are uniquely defined and are invariant with respect to left and or right unitary transformations of in other words the singular values of uav for unitary and are equal to the singular values of this is an important property for applications in which it is necessary to preserve euclidean distances and invariance with respect to rotations
the scale invariant svd or si svd is analogous to the conventional svd except that its uniquely determined singular values are invariant with respect to diagonal transformations of in other words the singular values of dae for invertible diagonal matrices and are equal to the singular values of this is an important property for applications for which invariance to the choice of units on variables metric versus imperial units is needed
higher order svd of functions hosvd tensor product tp model transformation numerically reconstruct the hosvd of functions
for further details please visit tensor product model transformation hosvd based canonical form of tp functions and qlpv models tp model transformation in control theory bounded operators on hilbert spaces the factorization can be extended to bounded operator on separable hilbert space namely for any bounded operator there exist partial isometry unitary measure space and non negative measurable such that where is the multiplication by on
this can be shown by mimicking the linear algebraic argument for the matricial case above
vtfv is the unique positive square root of as given by the borel functional calculus for self adjoint operators
the reason why need not be unitary is because unlike the finite dimensional case given an isometry with nontrivial kernel suitable may not be found such that is unitary operator
as for matrices the singular value factorization is equivalent to the polar decomposition for operators we can simply write and notice that is still partial isometry while vtfv is positive
singular values and compact operators the notion of singular values and left right singular vectors can be extended to compact operator on hilbert space as they have discrete spectrum
if is compact every non zero in its spectrum is an eigenvalue
furthermore compact self adjoint operator can be diagonalized by its eigenvectors
if is compact so is
applying the diagonalization result the unitary image of its positive square root tf has set of orthonormal eigenvectors
for any where the series converges in the norm topology on notice how this resembles the expression from the finite dimensional case
are called the singular values of can be considered the left singular resp
right singular vectors of compact operators on hilbert space are the closure of finite rank operators in the uniform operator topology
the above series expression gives an explicit such representation
an immediate consequence of this is theorem
is compact if and only if is compact
history the singular value decomposition was originally developed by differential geometers who wished to determine whether real bilinear form could be made equal to another by independent orthogonal transformations of the two spaces it acts on
eugenio beltrami and camille jordan discovered independently in and respectively that the singular values of the bilinear forms represented as matrix form complete set of invariants for bilinear forms under orthogonal substitutions
james joseph sylvester also arrived at the singular value decomposition for real square matrices in apparently independently of both beltrami and jordan
sylvester called the singular values the canonical multipliers of the matrix the fourth mathematician to discover the singular value decomposition independently is autonne in who arrived at it via the polar decomposition
the first proof of the singular value decomposition for rectangular and complex matrices seems to be by carl eckart and gale young in they saw it as generalization of the principal axis transformation for hermitian matrices
in erhard schmidt defined an analog of singular values for integral operators which are compact under some weak technical assumptions it seems he was unaware of the parallel work on singular values of finite matrices
this theory was further developed by mile picard in who is the first to call the numbers singular values or in french valeurs singuli res
practical methods for computing the svd date back to kogbetliantz in and hestenes in resembling closely the jacobi eigenvalue algorithm which uses plane rotations or givens rotations
however these were replaced by the method of gene golub and william kahan published in which uses householder transformations or reflections
in golub and christian reinsch published variant of the golub kahan algorithm that is still the one most used today

in probability theory and statistics covariance matrix also known as auto covariance matrix dispersion matrix variance matrix or variance covariance matrix is square matrix giving the covariance between each pair of elements of given random vector
any covariance matrix is symmetric and positive semi definite and its main diagonal contains variances the covariance of each element with itself
intuitively the covariance matrix generalizes the notion of variance to multiple dimensions
as an example the variation in collection of random points in two dimensional space cannot be characterized fully by single number nor would the variances in the and directions contain all of the necessary information matrix would be necessary to fully characterize the two dimensional variation
the covariance matrix of random vector is typically denoted by or
definition throughout this article boldfaced unsubscripted and are used to refer to random vectors and unboldfaced subscripted and are used to refer to scalar random variables
if the entries in the column vector
are random variables each with finite variance and expected value then the covariance matrix is the matrix whose entry is the covariance cov where the operator denotes the expected value mean of its argument
conflicting nomenclatures and notations nomenclatures differ
some statisticians following the probabilist william feller in his two volume book an introduction to probability theory and its applications call the matrix the variance of the random vector because it is the natural generalization to higher dimensions of the dimensional variance
others call it the covariance matrix because it is the matrix of covariances between the scalar components of the vector var cov
both forms are quite standard and there is no ambiguity between them
the matrix is also often called the variance covariance matrix since the diagonal terms are in fact variances
by comparison the notation for the cross covariance matrix between two vectors is cov
properties relation to the autocorrelation matrix the auto covariance matrix is related to the autocorrelation matrix by where the autocorrelation matrix is defined as
relation to the correlation matrix an entity closely related to the covariance matrix is the matrix of pearson product moment correlation coefficients between each of the random variables in the random vector which can be written as corr diag diag where diag is the matrix of the diagonal elements of diagonal matrix of the variances of for
equivalently the correlation matrix can be seen as the covariance matrix of the standardized random variables for corr
each element on the principal diagonal of correlation matrix is the correlation of random variable with itself which always equals each off diagonal element is between and inclusive
inverse of the covariance matrix the inverse of this matrix if it exists is the inverse covariance matrix or inverse concentration matrix also known as the precision matrix or concentration matrix just as the covariance matrix can be written as the rescaling of correlation matrix by the marginal variances cov so using the idea of partial correlation and partial variance the inverse covariance matrix can be expressed analogously cov this duality motivates number of other dualities between marginalizing and conditioning for gaussian random variables
basic properties for var and where is dimensional random variable the following basic properties apply is positive semidefinite
for all is symmetric
non random matrix and constant vector one has var var if is another random vector with the same dimension as then var var cov cov var where cov is the cross covariance matrix of and
block matrices the joint mean and joint covariance matrix of and can be written in block form where var var and cov
and can be identified as the variance matrices of the marginal distributions for and respectively
if and are jointly normally distributed then the conditional distribution for given is given by defined by conditional mean and conditional variance the matrix is known as the matrix of regression coefficients while in linear algebra is the schur complement of in the matrix of regression coefficients may often be given in transpose form suitable for post multiplying row vector of explanatory variables rather than pre multiplying column vector in this form they correspond to the coefficients obtained by inverting the matrix of the normal equations of ordinary least squares ols
partial covariance matrix covariance matrix with all non zero elements tells us that all the individual random variables are interrelated
this means that the variables are not only directly correlated but also correlated via other variables indirectly
often such indirect common mode correlations are trivial and uninteresting
they can be suppressed by calculating the partial covariance matrix that is the part of covariance matrix that shows only the interesting part of correlations
if two vectors of random variables and are correlated via another vector the latter correlations are suppressed in matrix pcov cov cov cov cov
the partial covariance matrix is effectively the simple covariance matrix as if the uninteresting random variables were held constant
covariance matrix as parameter of distribution if column vector of possibly correlated random variables is jointly normally distributed or more generally elliptically distributed then its probability density function can be expressed in terms of the covariance matrix as follows exp where and is the determinant of
covariance matrix as linear operator applied to one vector the covariance matrix maps linear combination of the random variables onto vector of covariances with those variables cov
treated as bilinear form it yields the covariance between the two linear combinations cov
the variance of linear combination is then its covariance with itself
similarly the pseudo inverse covariance matrix provides an inner product which induces the mahalanobis distance measure of the unlikelihood of which matrices are covariance matrices
from the identity just above let be real valued vector then var var which must always be nonnegative since it is the variance of real valued random variable so covariance matrix is always positive semidefinite matrix
the above argument can be expanded as follows where the last inequality follows from the observation that is scalar
conversely every symmetric positive semi definite matrix is covariance matrix
to see this suppose is symmetric positive semidefinite matrix
from the finite dimensional case of the spectral theorem it follows that has nonnegative symmetric square root which can be denoted by
let be any column vector valued random variable whose covariance matrix is the identity matrix
then var var complex random vectors the variance of complex scalar valued random variable with expected value is conventionally defined using complex conjugation var where the complex conjugate of complex number is denoted thus the variance of complex random variable is real number
if is column vector of complex valued random variables then the conjugate transpose is formed by both transposing and conjugating
in the following expression the product of vector with its conjugate transpose results in square matrix called the covariance matrix as its expectation cov the matrix so obtained will be hermitian positive semidefinite with real numbers in the main diagonal and complex numbers off diagonal
propertiesthe covariance matrix is hermitian matrix
the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are real
pseudo covariance matrix for complex random vectors another kind of second central moment the pseudo covariance matrix also called relation matrix is defined as follows cov in contrast to the covariance matrix defined above hermitian transposition gets replaced by transposition in the definition
its diagonal elements may be complex valued it is complex symmetric matrix
estimation if and are centred data matrices of dimension and respectively
with columns of observations of and rows of variables from which the row means have been subtracted then if the row means were estimated from the data sample covariance matrices and can be defined to be or if the row means were known priori these empirical sample covariance matrices are the most straightforward and most often used estimators for the covariance matrices but other estimators also exist including regularised or shrinkage estimators which may have better properties
applications the covariance matrix is useful tool in many different areas
from it transformation matrix can be derived called whitening transformation that allows one to completely decorrelate the data or from different point of view to find an optimal basis for representing the data in compact way see rayleigh quotient for formal proof and additional properties of covariance matrices
this is called principal component analysis pca and the karhunen lo ve transform kl transform
the covariance matrix plays key role in financial economics especially in portfolio theory and its mutual fund separation theorem and in the capital asset pricing model
the matrix of covariances among various assets returns is used to determine under certain assumptions the relative amounts of different assets that investors should in normative analysis or are predicted to in positive analysis choose to hold in context of diversification
use in optimization the evolution strategy particular family of randomized search heuristics fundamentally relies on covariance matrix in its mechanism
the characteristic mutation operator draws the update step from multivariate normal distribution using an evolving covariance matrix
there is formal proof that the evolution strategy covariance matrix adapts to the inverse of the hessian matrix of the search landscape up to scalar factor and small random fluctuations proven for single parent strategy and static model as the population size increases relying on the quadratic approximation
intuitively this result is supported by the rationale that the optimal covariance distribution can offer mutation steps whose equidensity probability contours match the level sets of the landscape and so they maximize the progress rate
covariance mapping in covariance mapping the values of the cov or pcov matrix are plotted as dimensional map
when vectors and are discrete random functions the map shows statistical relations between different regions of the random functions
statistically independent regions of the functions show up on the map as zero level flatland while positive or negative correlations show up respectively as hills or valleys
in practice the column vectors and are acquired experimentally as rows of samples
where is the th discrete value in sample of the random function
the expected values needed in the covariance formula are estimated using the sample mean
and the covariance matrix is estimated by the sample covariance matrix cov where the angular brackets denote sample averaging as before except that the bessel correction should be made to avoid bias
using this estimation the partial covariance matrix can be calculated as pcov cov cov cov cov where the backslash denotes the left matrix division operator which bypasses the requirement to invert matrix and is available in some computational packages such as matlab
illustrates how partial covariance map is constructed on an example of an experiment performed at the flash free electron laser in hamburg
the random function is the time of flight spectrum of ions from coulomb explosion of nitrogen molecules multiply ionised by laser pulse
since only few hundreds of molecules are ionised at each laser pulse the single shot spectra are highly fluctuating
however collecting typically such spectra and averaging them over produces smooth spectrum which is shown in red at the bottom of fig
the average spectrum reveals several nitrogen ions in form of peaks broadened by their kinetic energy but to find the correlations between the ionisation stages and the ion momenta requires calculating covariance map
in the example of fig
spectra and are the same except that the range of the time of flight differs
panel shows panel shows and panel shows their difference which is cov note change in the colour scale
unfortunately this map is overwhelmed by uninteresting common mode correlations induced by laser intensity fluctuating from shot to shot
to suppress such correlations the laser intensity is recorded at every shot put into and pcov is calculated as panels and show
the suppression of the uninteresting correlations is however imperfect because there are other sources of common mode fluctuations than the laser intensity and in principle all these sources should be monitored in vector yet in practice it is often sufficient to overcompensate the partial covariance correction as panel shows where interesting correlations of ion momenta are now clearly visible as straight lines centred on ionisation stages of atomic nitrogen
two dimensional infrared spectroscopy two dimensional infrared spectroscopy employs correlation analysis to obtain spectra of the condensed phase
there are two versions of this analysis synchronous and asynchronous
mathematically the former is expressed in terms of the sample covariance matrix and the technique is equivalent to covariance mapping

conceptual model is representation of system
it consists of concepts used to help people know understand or simulate subject the model represents
in contrast physical models are physical object such as toy model that may be assembled and made to work like the object it represents
the term may refer to models that are formed after conceptualization or generalization process
conceptual models are often abstractions of things in the real world whether physical or social
semantic studies are relevant to various stages of concept formation
semantics is basically about concepts the meaning that thinking beings give to various elements of their experience
overview models of concepts and models that are conceptual the term conceptual model is normal
it could mean model of concept or it could mean model that is conceptual
distinction can be made between what models are and what models are made of
with the exception of iconic models such as scale model of winchester cathedral most models are concepts
but they are mostly intended to be models of real world states of affairs
the value of model is usually directly proportional to how well it corresponds to past present future actual or potential state of affairs
model of concept is quite different because in order to be good model it need not have this real world correspondence
in artificial intelligence conceptual models and conceptual graphs are used for building expert systems and knowledge based systems here the analysts are concerned to represent expert opinion on what is true not their own ideas on what is true
type and scope of conceptual models conceptual models models that are conceptual range in type from the more concrete such as the mental image of familiar physical object to the formal generality and abstractness of mathematical models which do not appear to the mind as an image
conceptual models also range in terms of the scope of the subject matter that they are taken to represent
model may for instance represent single thing
the statue of liberty whole classes of things
the electron and even very vast domains of subject matter such as the physical universe
the variety and scope of conceptual models is due to the variety of purposes had by the people using them
conceptual modeling is the activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around us for the purposes of understanding and communication
fundamental objectives conceptual model primary objective is to convey the fundamental principles and basic functionality of the system which it represents
also conceptual model must be developed in such way as to provide an easily understood system interpretation for the model users
conceptual model when implemented properly should satisfy four fundamental objectives
enhance an individual understanding of the representative system facilitate efficient conveyance of system details between stakeholders provide point of reference for system designers to extract system specifications document the system for future reference and provide means for collaborationthe conceptual model plays an important role in the overall system development life cycle
figure below depicts the role of the conceptual model in typical system development scheme
it is clear that if the conceptual model is not fully developed the execution of fundamental system properties may not be implemented properly giving way to future problems or system shortfalls
these failures do occur in the industry and have been linked to lack of user input incomplete or unclear requirements and changing requirements
those weak links in the system design and development process can be traced to improper execution of the fundamental objectives of conceptual modeling
the importance of conceptual modeling is evident when such systemic failures are mitigated by thorough system development and adherence to proven development objectives techniques
modelling techniques as systems have become increasingly complex the role of conceptual modelling has dramatically expanded
with that expanded presence the effectiveness of conceptual modeling at capturing the fundamentals of system is being realized
building on that realization numerous conceptual modeling techniques have been created
these techniques can be applied across multiple disciplines to increase the user understanding of the system to be modeled
few techniques are briefly described in the following text however many more exist or are being developed
some commonly used conceptual modeling techniques and methods include workflow modeling workforce modeling rapid application development object role modeling and the unified modeling language uml
data flow modeling data flow modeling dfm is basic conceptual modeling technique that graphically represents elements of system
dfm is fairly simple technique however like many conceptual modeling techniques it is possible to construct higher and lower level representative diagrams
the data flow diagram usually does not convey complex system details such as parallel development considerations or timing information but rather works to bring the major system functions into context
data flow modeling is central technique used in systems development that utilizes the structured systems analysis and design method ssadm
entity relationship modeling entity relationship modeling erm is conceptual modeling technique used primarily for software system representation
entity relationship diagrams which are product of executing the erm technique are normally used to represent database models and information systems
the main components of the diagram are the entities and relationships
the entities can represent independent functions objects or events
the relationships are responsible for relating the entities to one another
to form system process the relationships are combined with the entities and any attributes needed to further describe the process
multiple diagramming conventions exist for this technique idef bachman and express to name few
these conventions are just different ways of viewing and organizing the data to represent different system aspects
event driven process chain the event driven process chain epc is conceptual modeling technique which is mainly used to systematically improve business process flows
like most conceptual modeling techniques the event driven process chain consists of entities elements and functions that allow relationships to be developed and processed
more specifically the epc is made up of events which define what state process is in or the rules by which it operates
in order to progress through events function active event must be executed
depending on the process flow the function has the ability to transform event states or link to other event driven process chains
other elements exist within an epc all of which work together to define how and by what rules the system operates
the epc technique can be applied to business practices such as resource planning process improvement and logistics
joint application development the dynamic systems development method uses specific process called jefff to conceptually model systems life cycle
jefff is intended to focus more on the higher level development planning that precedes project initialization
the jad process calls for series of workshops in which the participants work to identify define and generally map successful project from conception to completion
this method has been found to not work well for large scale applications however smaller applications usually report some net gain in efficiency
place transition net also known as petri nets this conceptual modeling technique allows system to be constructed with elements that can be described by direct mathematical means
the petri net because of its nondeterministic execution properties and well defined mathematical theory is useful technique for modeling concurrent system behavior
state transition modeling state transition modeling makes use of state transition diagrams to describe system behavior
these state transition diagrams use distinct states to define system behavior and changes
most current modeling tools contain some kind of ability to represent state transition modeling
the use of state transition models can be most easily recognized as logic state diagrams and directed graphs for finite state machines
technique evaluation and selection because the conceptual modeling method can sometimes be purposefully vague to account for broad area of use the actual application of concept modeling can become difficult
to alleviate this issue and shed some light on what to consider when selecting an appropriate conceptual modeling technique the framework proposed by gemino and wand will be discussed in the following text
however before evaluating the effectiveness of conceptual modeling technique for particular application an important concept must be understood comparing conceptual models by way of specifically focusing on their graphical or top level representations is shortsighted
gemino and wand make good point when arguing that the emphasis should be placed on conceptual modeling language when choosing an appropriate technique
in general conceptual model is developed using some form of conceptual modeling technique
that technique will utilize conceptual modeling language that determines the rules for how the model is arrived at
understanding the capabilities of the specific language used is inherent to properly evaluating conceptual modeling technique as the language reflects the techniques descriptive ability
also the conceptual modeling language will directly influence the depth at which the system is capable of being represented whether it be complex or simple
considering affecting factors building on some of their earlier work gemino and wand acknowledge some main points to consider when studying the affecting factors the content that the conceptual model must represent the method in which the model will be presented the characteristics of the model users and the conceptual model languages specific task
the conceptual model content should be considered in order to select technique that would allow relevant information to be presented
the presentation method for selection purposes would focus on the technique ability to represent the model at the intended level of depth and detail
the characteristics of the model users or participants is an important aspect to consider
participant background and experience should coincide with the conceptual model complexity else misrepresentation of the system or misunderstanding of key system concepts could lead to problems in that system realization
the conceptual model language task will further allow an appropriate technique to be chosen
the difference between creating system conceptual model to convey system functionality and creating system conceptual model to interpret that functionality could involve two completely different types of conceptual modeling languages
considering affected variables gemino and wand go on to expand the affected variable content of their proposed framework by considering the focus of observation and the criterion for comparison
the focus of observation considers whether the conceptual modeling technique will create new product or whether the technique will only bring about more intimate understanding of the system being modeled
the criterion for comparison would weigh the ability of the conceptual modeling technique to be efficient or effective
conceptual modeling technique that allows for development of system model which takes all system variables into account at high level may make the process of understanding the system functionality more efficient but the technique lacks the necessary information to explain the internal processes rendering the model less effective
when deciding which conceptual technique to use the recommendations of gemino and wand can be applied in order to properly evaluate the scope of the conceptual model in question
understanding the conceptual models scope will lead to more informed selection of technique that properly addresses that particular model
in summary when deciding between modeling techniques answering the following questions would allow one to address some important conceptual modeling considerations
what content will the conceptual model represent
how will the conceptual model be presented
who will be using or participating in the conceptual model
how will the conceptual model describe the system
what is the conceptual models focus of observation
will the conceptual model be efficient or effective in describing the system another function of the simulation conceptual model is to provide rational and factual basis for assessment of simulation application appropriateness
general model theory model is simplifying image of reality
the image can be either sensorily above all optically observable artefact or given purely theoretically
according to herbert stachowiak model is characterized by at least three properties mapping model always is model of something it is an image or representation of some natural or artificial existing or imagined original where this original itself could be model
reduction in general model will not include all attributes that describe the original but only those that appear as relevant to the model creator or user
pragmatism model does not relate unambiguously to its original
it is intended to work as replacement for the original for certain subjects for whom
within certain time range when
restricted to certain conceptual or physical actions what for
for example street map is model of the actual streets in city mapping showing the course of the streets while leaving out say traffic signs and road markings reduction made for pedestrians and vehicle drivers for the purpose of finding one way in the city pragmatism
additional properties have been proposed like extension and distortion as well as validity
the american philosopher michael weisberg differentiates between concrete and mathematical models and proposes computer simulations computational models as their own class of models
models in philosophy and science mental model in cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind mental model is representation of something in the mind but mental model may also refer to nonphysical external model of the mind itself
metaphysical models metaphysical model is type of conceptual model which is distinguished from other conceptual models by its proposed scope metaphysical model intends to represent reality in the broadest possible way
this is to say that it explains the answers to fundamental questions such as whether matter and mind are one or two substances or whether or not humans have free will
conceptual model vs semantics model conceptual models and semantic models have many similarities however the way they are presented the level of flexibility and the use are different
conceptual models have certain purpose in mind hence the core semantic concepts are predefined in so called meta model
this enables pragmatic modelling but reduces the flexibility as only the predefined semantic concepts can be used
samples are flow charts for process behaviour or organisational structure for tree behaviour
semantic models are more flexible and open and therefore more difficult to model
potentially any semantic concept can be defined hence the modelling support is very generic
samples are terminologies taxonomies or ontologies
in concept model each concept has unique and distinguishable graphical representation whereas semantic concepts are by default the same
in concept model each concept has predefined properties that can be populated whereas semantic concepts are related to concepts that are interpreted as properties
in concept model operational semantic can be built in like the processing of sequence whereas semantic model needs explicit semantic definition of the sequence
the decision if concept model or semantic model is used depends therefore on the object under survey the intended goal the necessary flexibility as well as how the model is interpreted
in case of human interpretation there may be focus on graphical concept models in case of machine interpretation there may be the focus on semantic models
epistemological models an epistemological model is type of conceptual model whose proposed scope is the known and the knowable and the believed and the believable
logical models in logic model is type of interpretation under which particular statement is true
logical models can be broadly divided into ones which only attempt to represent concepts such as mathematical models and ones which attempt to represent physical objects and factual relationships among which are scientific models
model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures such as groups fields graphs or even universes of set theory using tools from mathematical logic
system that gives meaning to the sentences of formal language is called model for the language
if model for language moreover satisfies particular sentence or theory set of sentences it is called model of the sentence or theory
model theory has close ties to algebra and universal algebra
mathematical models mathematical models can take many forms including but not limited to dynamical systems statistical models differential equations or game theoretic models
these and other types of models can overlap with given model involving variety of abstract structures
more comprehensive type of mathematical model uses linguistic version of category theory to model given situation
akin to entity relationship models custom categories or sketches can be directly translated into database schemas
the difference is that logic is replaced by category theory which brings powerful theorems to bear on the subject of modeling especially useful for translating between disparate models as functors between categories
scientific models scientific model is simplified abstract view of complex reality
scientific model represents empirical objects phenomena and physical processes in logical way
attempts to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences use an interpretation to model reality in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic
the aim of these attempts is to construct formal system that will not produce theoretical consequences that are contrary to what is found in reality
predictions or other statements drawn from such formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true
statistical models statistical model is probability distribution function proposed as generating data
in parametric model the probability distribution function has variable parameters such as the mean and variance in normal distribution or the coefficients for the various exponents of the independent variable in linear regression
nonparametric model has distribution function without parameters such as in bootstrapping and is only loosely confined by assumptions
model selection is statistical method for selecting distribution function within class of them in linear regression where the dependent variable is polynomial of the independent variable with parametric coefficients model selection is selecting the highest exponent and may be done with nonparametric means such as with cross validation
in statistics there can be models of mental events as well as models of physical events
for example statistical model of customer behavior is model that is conceptual because behavior is physical but statistical model of customer satisfaction is model of concept because satisfaction is mental not physical event
social and political models economic models in economics model is theoretical construct that represents economic processes by set of variables and set of logical and or quantitative relationships between them
the economic model is simplified framework designed to illustrate complex processes often but not always using mathematical techniques
frequently economic models use structural parameters
structural parameters are underlying parameters in model or class of models
model may have various parameters and those parameters may change to create various properties
models in systems architecture system model is the conceptual model that describes and represents the structure behavior and more views of system
system model can represent multiple views of system by using two different approaches
the first one is the non architectural approach and the second one is the architectural approach
the non architectural approach respectively picks model for each view
the architectural approach also known as system architecture instead of picking many heterogeneous and unrelated models will use only one integrated architectural model
business process modelling in business process modelling the enterprise process model is often referred to as the business process model
process models are core concepts in the discipline of process engineering
process models are processes of the same nature that are classified together into model
description of process at the type level
since the process model is at the type level process is an instantiation of it the same process model is used repeatedly for the development of many applications and thus has many instantiations
one possible use of process model is to prescribe how things must should could be done in contrast to the process itself which is really what happens
process model is roughly an anticipation of what the process will look like
what the process shall be will be determined during actual system development
models in information system design conceptual models of human activity systems conceptual models of human activity systems are used in soft systems methodology ssm which is method of systems analysis concerned with the structuring of problems in management
these models are models of concepts the authors specifically state that they are not intended to represent state of affairs in the physical world
they are also used in information requirements analysis ira which is variant of ssm developed for information system design and software engineering
logico linguistic models logico linguistic modeling is another variant of ssm that uses conceptual models
however this method combines models of concepts with models of putative real world objects and events
it is graphical representation of modal logic in which modal operators are used to distinguish statement about concepts from statements about real world objects and events
data models entity relationship model in software engineering an entity relationship model erm is an abstract and conceptual representation of data
entity relationship modeling is database modeling method used to produce type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of system often relational database and its requirements in top down fashion
diagrams created by this process are called entity relationship diagrams er diagrams or erds
entity relationship models have had wide application in the building of information systems intended to support activities involving objects and events in the real world
in these cases they are models that are conceptual
however this modeling method can be used to build computer games or family tree of the greek gods in these cases it would be used to model concepts
domain model domain model is type of conceptual model used to depict the structural elements and their conceptual constraints within domain of interest sometimes called the problem domain
domain model includes the various entities their attributes and relationships plus the constraints governing the conceptual integrity of the structural model elements comprising that problem domain
domain model may also include number of conceptual views where each view is pertinent to particular subject area of the domain or to particular subset of the domain model which is of interest to stakeholder of the domain model
like entity relationship models domain models can be used to model concepts or to model real world objects and events
